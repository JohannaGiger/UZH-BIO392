## üß¨ SNP Exploration 
Below is a list of curated SNPs for exploration: 

---

| number | SNP (rsID)  | Gene / Region | Notable Trait / Use |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 1       | rs7903146   | *TCF7L2*       | Type 2 Diabetes      |
| 2       | rs1426654   | *SLC24A5*      | Skin Pigmentation    |
| 3       | rs429358    | *APOE*         | Alzheimer's Disease  |
| 4       | rs334       | *HBB*          | Sickle Cell Anemia   |
| 5       | rs12913832  | *HERC2*        | Eye Color            |

Please investigate each of SNP using the following databases:

- **GWAS Catalog**: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas  
- **Ensembl Variant Browser**: https://www.ensembl.org
  
## üìå **Tip**
- Use the LocusZoom in GWAS Catalog and population frequency features in Ensembl to explore regulatory impact and population distribution!
- Refer to this link for guidance on the GWAS Catalog, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/gwas-catalogue-exploring-snp-trait-associations/

## üîç Tasks
For each SNP, answer the following:

1. What chromosome and position is the SNP on?
2. What is the variant type? (e.g., intronic, missense)
3. What are the reference and alternate alleles?
