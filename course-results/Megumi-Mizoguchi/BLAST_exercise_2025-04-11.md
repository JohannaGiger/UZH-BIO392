#BLAST Exercise

1. Use blast in NCBI to search the unknown nucleotide sequence
- Which organism does this sequence belong to?
    - SARS-CoV-2
- Pick one blast result. What is the accession number, max score, query cover and E value?
    - LR877818.1, 6929, 100%, 0.0

- Which region does this sequence cover the subject sequence? (The answer could be different which depends on the accession that you choose)
    - Range: 21584 to 25335 in 29780 bp

- Is it DNA or RNA sequence?
    - DNA

- Does it encode a (part of) protein? If yes, which protein? (Hint: use different blast type)
    - Surface glycoprotein

2. Use blast in Uniprot to search the unknown protein sequence
- Select the most possible one among manually reviewed entries. What is its Uniprot ID?
    - P01116

- What protein does this sequence come from?
    - GTPase KRas

- Which organism does this sequence belong to?
    - Homo sapiens

- What is the function of this protein?
    - Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (PubMed:20949621). Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:22711838, PubMed:23698361).Plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in a ZNF304-dependent manner (PubMed:24623306)

- What is the variant associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in this protein?
    - Variant ID: VAR_034601

3. If you have more time, play around to feel the difference of blast service from different databases
For example,
- Use Blast in NCBI to query the protein sequence
- Use Blast in Uniprot to query the nucleotide sequence
