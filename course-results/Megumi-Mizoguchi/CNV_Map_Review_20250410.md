### **1. Why is it important to construct a CNV map on healthy individuals of various ethnicities?**

Because CNVs can have different effects in different populations. Some may be harmless in one group but harmful in another. A diverse map helps distinguish between benign and pathogenic CNVs and improves clinical diagnosis.

### **2. What is the CNV size that the authors defined?**

CNVs are defined as DNA segments larger than 50 base pairs (bp). This is the threshold used in this study.

### **3. What are the primary approaches used for CNV detection? What are their advantages and limitations?**

- Microarrays (CGH, SNP arrays): Good for finding duplications, but may miss small or complex CNVs.  
- Next-generation sequencing (NGS): Very sensitive and accurate, but may miss duplications and is computationally heavy.

### **4. What are the two criteria for cluster filtering? Why?**

1. Number of subjects with the CNV  
2. Number of studies that found the CNV  
They filtered to remove false positives and study-specific errors.

### **5. What are the thresholds for different stringency levels?**

- Level 1: 1 subject, 1 study (includes all CNVs)  
- Inclusive map (Level 2): 2 subjects, 1 study  
- Stringent map (Level 12): 2 subjects, 2 studies

### **6. What percentage of the genome contributes to CNV?**

- Inclusive map: 9.5%  
- Stringent map: 4.8%

### **7. Which type of genes are more variable, protein-coding or non-coding? What did the authors find?**

Non-coding genes are more variable. The study confirmed this. Protein-coding and disease-related genes are more conserved and less affected by CNVs.

### **8. What are the functions of the homozygously deleted genes? Why are they non-essential?**

They are involved in metabolism, immunity, blood type, and pregnancy. These genes are considered non-essential because people can lack them and still be healthy. Many have backups (paralogues).

### **9. How can a doctor use this CNV map in clinical practice?**
To decide if a CNV is likely benign or pathogenic,
1. Check if a CNV is in the map  
2. See if it overlaps with disease genes  
3. Use stringency levels to judge confidence  
4. Consider patient background (ethnicity, age)
