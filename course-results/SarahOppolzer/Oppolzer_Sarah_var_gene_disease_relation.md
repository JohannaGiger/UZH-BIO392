## Variants and diseases

### Relational list using [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)

|Disease|Disease description|Gene|Variants（HGVS)|
|-------|-------------------|----|--------|
|Hemochromatosis|a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet|TFR2|NM_003227.4:c.2093_2096de|
|Thalassemia|is an inherited blood disorder that affects a body’s ability to produce hemoglobin and healthy red blood cells|ATRX|NM_000489.6:c.134-2A>G|
|Haemophilia|is a rare condition that affects the way blood clots, meaning that one bleads more easily than others|F8|NM_000132.4:c.670+1G>A|
|Cystic Fibrosis|is a metabolic disease. It is congenital and one of the most common inherited diseases. Symptoms are viscous mucus in the lungs and often also discomfort in the digestive tract|CFTR|NM_000492.4:c.1891dup (p.Ser631fs)|
|Tay sachs disease|is a rare inheritable genetic disorder. It's caused by the absence of an enzyme that helps break down fatty substances. These fatty substances build up to toxic levels and affect the function of the nerve cells|HEXA|NM_000520.6:c.72G>A|
|Fragile X syndrome|is the leading cause of inherited intellectual disabilities. There are behavioral, physical, intellectual and mental health symptoms|FMR1|NM_002024.6:c.413G>A|
|Huntington's disease|is a genetic condition that affects the cells in the brain. Common symptoms affect your movement, thoughts and feelings|HTT|NM_001388492.1:c.6250G>A|

** Strategy: I always chose the most relevant output, with the filters "pathogenic" and "multiple submitters". However, for Fragile X syndome and Huntington disease, no pathogenic variant was detected, therefore I searched without this filter and selected the most relevant one.
