# Estimate Storage Requirements for 1000 Genomes

#### WES & WGS 
Whole genome sequencing - WGS - and whole exome sequencing - WES - are two of the most popular methods used in genetic research. WGS sequences the entire genome, so it includes protein-coding and non-protein-coding regions. Therefore, allmost all changes in the DNA can be identified. WES only sequences the protein - coding regions. It is cheaper, since the ampunt of data generated is sigcnificantly less then with WGS. The majority of diease-causing variants are in the exome, therefore  WES is quite a powerful tool to identify genetic causes for disease. However, WGS provides a more compreensive picture of other variants. Especially rare and novel variants might be missed with WES (see [source] (https://www.novogene.com/eu-en/resources/blog/wgs-vs-wes-which-genetic-sequencing-method-is-right-for-you/)). 


How much computer storage is required for 1000 Genomes???

Diﬀerent file formats

Please provide 1-page size estimates and reasoning for the use of the different file types 
(i.e. which would you use for storing called variants, which for full archival purposes, browser
visualisation), for 3-5 formats.
