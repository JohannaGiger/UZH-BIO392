# The human reference genome, T2T and Pangenomes

- The human reference genome, that has been used since 2001 represents mosaics of individual haplotypes that contain a representative 
sequence for eachchromosome. However, it includes many gaps of unknown sequences, especially in repetetive regions, and computationally 
simulated sequences. This creates an observational bias which is limiting the studies using this reference genome. 

- The T2T – Telomere to Telomere – genome  was the first (nearly) fully complete human genome and includes a nearly complete representation 
of each autosome and Chromosome X. This led to the discovery of 3.7 million additional SNPs and a more accurate representation of SNPs.

- Since no single genome can represent the genetic diversity of humans, there was a shift to using pangenomes for reference. There, a 
diversity of individual genomes are sequenced and assembled and then represent a draft human pangenome. This is supposed to capture our 
global genomic difersity better. 


## What is the benefit of using Pangenomes?
With the usage of pangenomes references, small variant discovery errors could be reduces by 34% and the number of structural variantes 
detected per haplotype increased by 104% compared tot he human reference genome. Also, in comparison with the T2T reference genome, the 
usage oft he pangenome reference lead to a more accurate representation oft he genetic diversity. Like mentioned, the reference bias was 
reduced, since the pan genome originates from people with different genetic backgrounds. Therefore, this enables better variant discovery of 
populations, that were underrepresented before. This is also highly important with regards to personalized medicine, which should be equaly 
acessible to people with all kinds of genetic backgrounds.
