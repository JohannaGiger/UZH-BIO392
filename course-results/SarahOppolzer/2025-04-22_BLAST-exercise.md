## Use blast in NCBI to search the unknown nucleotide sequence
- Which organism does this sequence belong to?
  coronavirus 2
  
- Pick one blast result. What is the accession number, max score, query cover and E value?
  Accession number: LR877818.1, Max Score: 6929, query cover: 100%, E value: 0.0
  
- Which region does this sequence cover the subject sequence? (The answer could be different which depends on
the accession that you choose)


- Is it DNA or RNA sequence?
  DNA
  
- Does it encode a (part of) protein? If yes, which protein? (Hint: use different blast type)
  unkknown nuclotide sequence

## Use blast in Uniprot to search the unknown protein sequence
- Select the most possible one among manually reviewed entries. What is its Uniprot ID? 
- What protein does this sequence come from?
- Which organism does this sequence belong to? Humann
- What is the function of this protein?
- What is the variant associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in this protein?


## If you have more time, play around to feel the difference of blast service from different databases
For example,
- Use Blast in NCBI to query the protein sequence
- Use Blast in Uniprot to query the nucleotide sequence
