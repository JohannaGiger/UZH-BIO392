Activity 3
We started our investigation on EVA (European Variation Archive). This archive provides 1539 variations for the protein SOD2 on the human
GRCh38.p3 reverence genome and 6587 variations for the GRCh37 reference genome. We decided to continue with the GRCh38.p3 for our further
search. On the output, the table was also apparent that our protein of interest is located on chromosome 6.

We continued with the ensemble website with links we found on the table for our variation request.  For our gene of interest on the SNP
missense variant (variant ID rs4880) was listed. This variant seems to have clinical significance regarding response to cyclophosphamide,
which is a drug used in chemotherapy and works as an immune suppressor. Furthermore, it might be involved in microvascular complications
of diabetes, however, the databank entry was not reviewed by expert panel. 
The dbSNP website told us that the transcript variants are located at position 47(T > C) on the SOD2 gene with corresponding with the
change Valine to Alanine at position 16 in the amino acid sequence. For verification we calculated how many bases are used for 16 amino
acids and calculated which three bases code for amino acid 16 (in this case Valine) using the fact that each codon consists of three
bases. We determined that bases 46-48 cod for this amino acid. Consulting the DNA codon table confirmed that a change T to C at position
47(second base of respective codon) results in a mutation Valine to Alanine.
We then went to UniProt to the feature viewer and saw as expected that there is a variant at position 16 that is likely related to
disease. This is the only entry on the feature viewer for a disease-related variant for this protein.
