# Task: Estimate storage requirements for 1'000 genomes

## Without a specific file format

To just store the sequence, $2$ bits per base are sufficient.
* WGS (whole genome sequencing) will cover roughly $6'000'000'000$ b which translates to about $715$ MB storage (according to the slides).
* WES (whole exome sequencing) will cover about $30'000'000$ b which translates to $3.75$ MB storage[^1].
