# The Progenetix oncogenomic resource in 2021
## Questions regarding the paper

### 1: What is CNV/CNA?

CNV stands for "copy number variants" and refers to changes in the number of gene copies in an individual genome.
CNA stands for "copy number aberrations" and refers to deletions or amplifications of large continuous genome segments.

### 2: How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)?

Progenetix is the largest publicly accessible cancer genome database with individual sample data. It brings together data from various sources, including publications and various datasets that only existed seperately before. The focus lies on copy number abnormalities (CNVs/CNAs). In 2021, it included data from 138'663 samples.
The main data sources are the "ArrayExpress Archive of Functional Genomics Data", the "cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics", "The Cancer Genome Atlas Program" (TCGA), the "arrayMap data collection" and the "Gene Expression Omnibus".

### 3: Describe NCIt, ICDO, UBERON codes, and their relationships.

"ICD-O" stands for "International Classification of Diseases in Oncology", "NCIt" for "National Cancer Institute Thesaurus. Both are used for cancer sample classification. While ICD-O is very accurate regarding the morphology and topography of diagnostic entities, NDIt makes use of a hierarchical structure and translates better to modern ontologies.

### 4: What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them?

### 5: What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?

### 6: How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?

### 7: What do you think should be improved in progenetix?
