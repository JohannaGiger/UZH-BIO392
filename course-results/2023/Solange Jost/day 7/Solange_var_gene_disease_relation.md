|----|---------|--------------------|------------|-------|-------------------|
|CFTR|CF transmembrane conductance regulator|7q31.2|epithelial ion channel, transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane|Cystic fibrosis|a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity|		 |
|CYBB|cytochrome b-245 beta chain|Xp21.1-p11.4|component of membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes, voltage-gated proton channel, regulates cellular pH|granulomatous disease|a genetic disorder in which phagocytes are unable to kill certain types of bacteria and fungi|
|HJV|hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor|1q21.1|bone morphogenic protein coreceptor, enhances BMP signaling and thus regulates HAMP expression and iron homeostasis|hemochromatosis type 2A|a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet|
