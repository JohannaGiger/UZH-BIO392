# Genomic data and privacy

In which areas of our daily lives will the use of genomic data be implemented in the future? Where do we draw the line between progress and substantial restriction of our freedom? \
While techniques like polygenic screening of embryos or DNA-rendered phantom images can contribute to better health and security in our society, the options to abuse these methods are endless. 

When it comes to my own genomic data, my opinion is complex. I personally wouldn’t want to know about mutations etc. in my genome increasing the risks to develop certain diseases. Even if there were certain lifestyle changes that I could make to decrease that risk, I would live in constant fear and anticipation of a diagnosis that may never happen. So, at the moment, I’m not really interested in submitting my genome to some company. Even less so in a context not related to diseases (such as finding out about your ancestry), having just learned about how these companies could possibly treat my data. 

Submitting my genome data for research purposes is a different thing. If the lab collecting the data could somehow ensure that the data can only be accessed in an encoded manner and noone can back-track it to myself, I would agree.

But can we make every decision on this topic freely? And will it stay that way? Let's take polygenic screening of embryos as an example:
The easier it gets to determine PRS's (polygenic risk scores) pre-natally, the more insurance companies will want to use this to save costs. Imagine a case in which insurancy companies won't cover the hospital bills of your disabled child due to you knowing the risk. That is, by your decision to carry on with the pregnancy, you basically decided to cover the costs yourself. Which also would mean that poor families basically have no free choice in this case.
