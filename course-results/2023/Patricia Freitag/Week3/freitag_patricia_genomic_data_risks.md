# Genomic data risks and opportunities

## Risks 

+ Secondary use of data
  

+ Re-identification 

+ Genetic discrimination

+ Data ownership



## Opportunities 

+ Healthcare: Personalized medicine relies on genomic data. In order to get access to personalized treatment, early detection and disease risk assessment,
  your genomic data is needed. I personally think that it is worth it to provide my data as to get the best treatment possible, especially for serious diseases, such as cancer. 
  However, I would say that it is not necessary to know whether or not one carries certain risk factors for certain diseases, as this can not be influenced 
  and can cause more damage than good.
  
+ Family planning: Some monogenic inherited diseases can be prevented if you get genetic screening done. Genomic data can identify whether an individual carries genetic mutations
  associated with inherited diseases. For example, mutations in genes like the CFTR gene (cystic fibrosis) or the HBB gene (sickle cell anemia) can be detected through genomic analysis.
  If both partner carry the gene, there is a 1/4 chance that the child will inherit both copies, and in this case, alternative options, such as IVF or adoption could be discussed.
  Nonetheless, this raises ethical concerns. The topics of selective breeding and equitable access to genetic resources are just two examples of sensitive topics that could be
  discussed in this context.
