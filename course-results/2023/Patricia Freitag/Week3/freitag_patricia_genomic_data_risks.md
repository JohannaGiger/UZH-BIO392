# Genomic data risks and opportunities

## Risks 

+ Secondary use of data: 
Sometimes genetic information collected for one purpose will be used for additional, often unrelated, purposes. While this can facilitate new discoveries and insights, it also raises ethical questions regarding informed consent and data privacy. It's crucial to establish clear guidelines and transparency when repurposing genomic data to ensure that individuals' rights and privacy are respected.

+ Re-identification: 
Advances in data analytics and the availability of other publicly accessible information can make re-identification increasingly feasible. As we learned during the lecture, this is for instance possible using Beacon. Protecting against re-identification requires de-identification techniques and data access controls to protect individuals sensitive genetic information.

+ Genetic discrimination:
  Genetic discrimination refers to unfair treatment of individuals based on their genetic information, potentially in areas like employment, insurance, or education. Laws and regulations in many countries aim to protect individuals from such discrimination. However, we still have to ensure that genetic data is not used to unfairly disadvantage individuals or communities, and that legal protections are effectively enforced.

+ Data ownership
  The question of who owns genetic data is complex, it is often not clear whether it belongs to individuals, research institutions, or healthcare providers. Balancing the interests of all parties while safeguarding individual rights and privacy is important in data ownership in genomics.

## Opportunities 

+ Healthcare: Personalized medicine relies on genomic data. In order to get access to personalized treatment, early detection and disease risk assessment,
  your genomic data is needed. I personally think that it is worth it to provide my data as to get the best treatment possible, especially for serious diseases, such as   
  cancer. 
  However, I would say that it is not necessary to know whether or not one carries certain risk factors for certain diseases, as this can not be influenced 
  and can cause more damage than good.
  
+ Family planning: Some monogenic inherited diseases can be prevented if you get genetic screening done. Genomic data can identify whether an individual carries genetic mutations
  associated with inherited diseases. For example, mutations in genes like the CFTR gene (cystic fibrosis) or the HBB gene (sickle cell anemia) can be detected through genomic analysis.
  If both partner carry the gene, there is a 1/4 chance that the child will inherit both copies, and in this case, alternative options, such as IVF or adoption could be discussed.
  Nonetheless, this raises ethical concerns. The topics of selective breeding and equitable access to genetic resources are just two examples of sensitive topics that could be
  discussed in this context.


## Own stance

I find the current possibilities surrounding genomic data truly remarkable, although I'm torn when considering the balance between the opportunities and risks these new technologies present. On one hand, the prospect of personalized treatments offering improved survival rates is promising, and I'm open to such advancements. Nevertheless, there's a side to this technology that I'm less fond of.

In particular, I struggle with the idea of knowing which diseases I might be at an elevated risk for. While the potential benefits are obvious, I personally believe that the anxiety and psychological burden associated with being aware of such elevated risks outweigh these advantages. Essentially, it raises the question of whether knowing every detail about our genetic predispositions is always the right path to take.
