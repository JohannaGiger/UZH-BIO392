## What is CNV/CNA

Copy Number Variation/Copy Number Alteration 

Describes a structural variation, either a deletion or duplication that affects a larger region of the genome. 

## How will you describe or introduce progenetix?

Progenetix is a publicly accessible adatabase that provides data on mutations in different human cancers, focusing on CNVs/CNAs. They currently provide data from over 100'000 samples from about 800 cancer types. One of the main goals is to provide a centralized repository of high-quality genomic data, tools, and resources. 

## Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships

NCIt:  *National Cancer Institute Thesaurus* 

standard for biomedical coding, widely used in cancer research to standardize terminology used in this field, comprehensive hierarchy of terms and concepts related to cancer 

ICOD: *International Classification of Diseases for Oncology*

classification system used to describe and code neoplasms, standardization in the classification of cancer cases.

UBERON 

a cross-species anatomical structural ontology system closely aligned with developmental processes, its relationship structure allows queries linking multiple databases (e.g. Gene Ontology and Protein Ontology) and description logic query within the same organism (linking related organs) and between model animals and humans. 

Their relationship: they are all codes and ontologies used in the field of biomedical and clinical research


## What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them?

CNV segements represent the part of the genome which shows variation in number.
CNV frequencies tell us how often a particular type of genetic variation, called a copy number variation (CNV), appears in a group of people. It helps us understand whether a specific CNV is common or rare among individuals in that group. 



## What are API's and how to use APIs in progenetix

Application Programming Interfaces

Allows two computers or computer programs to communicate with each other, Beacon is the API that is used in Progenetix

## How does progenetix visualize CNA profiles?

All the chromosomes (1-22 + XY) are linearly represented on top, taking their size into consideration. Below the chromosomes are the percentages of gains in yellow and deletions in blue in the samples provided for the specific cancer. 

## What do you think should be improved in progenetix? 

Some cancer types (e.g. Myxoid Chondrosarcoma, Recurrent Neoplasm, Benign prostatic hyperplasia) do not consist of many samples, so an improvement would be to provide more data for these cancer types, which could be solved by finding additional suitable platforms providing high quality data.
