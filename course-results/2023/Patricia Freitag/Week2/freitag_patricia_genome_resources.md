European Nucleotide Archive

The ENA is a biological database maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). It provides a comprehensive record of the worldâ€™s nucleotide sequencing information, covering raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information and functional annotation




# Interpreted Databases
## Gene Ontology
https://geneontology.org/

The largest source of information on the functions of genes. Its function is to provide annotations for genes and proteins which describe their functions, roles, and relationships in biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. It also enables researchers to compare and analyze genes and proteins, interpret Experimental Data and support their research.
