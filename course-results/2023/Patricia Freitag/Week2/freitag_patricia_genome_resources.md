# Primary deposition databases

Primary deposition databases store raw, original biological sequences. It is basically the first place where data is stored, after it has been discovered. The data on these databases can then be used by other researchers for their own purposes. 

## GenBank
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/

GenBank is a repository for DNA and RNA sequences. It is an open access database. The sequences are annotated and include information about genes, (non) coding regions and regulatory elements. It provides the nucleotide sequences for over 300'000 organisms. 

## ENA

European Nucleotide Archive

The ENA is a biological database maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). It provides a comprehensive record of the worldâ€™s nucleotide sequencing information, covering raw sequencing data, sequence assembly information and functional annotation




# Interpreted Databases

While the primary database stores raw datam the interpreted databases organize the data, explain it and make it easier for researchers to understand it. 

## Gene Ontology
https://geneontology.org/

The largest source of information on the functions of genes. Its function is to provide annotations for genes and proteins which describe their functions, roles, and relationships in biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. It also enables researchers to compare and analyze genes and proteins, interpret Experimental Data and support their research. 

## Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)
https://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php

Database that compiles information about known genetic mutations associated with human diseases. It is used for studying the genetic basis of inherited diseases. 

# Other genome resources

## Rice Genome Annotation Project
http://rice.uga.edu/

Provides the sequence and annotation data of the 12 rice, which is the one of the most important crops, chromosomes. One example of researchers working on rice is the Golden Rice, which is engineered to produce beta-carotene (provitamin A). 

## Mice Genome Informatics (MGI)
https://www.informatics.jax.org/

Mice are frequently used animal models, hence it makes sense to have a genome data resource specifically for mice. MGI provides DNA and RNA sequences, SNPs, polymorphisms and various other information on mouse models.
