 What is CNV/CNA?
 CNV: copy number variation
 CNA: copy number aberration
 structural genome variations
 used to characterize molecular subtypes
 
How will you describe or introduce progenetix?
It is a resource that is accessible by the public. Its goal is to represent all different cancer profiles
-scale: 138'663 (115'357 tumor) copy number variation profiles
-data source: publications based on molecular cytogenetics and sequencing
-cancer types
-which information does it provide: profiles and their metadata, services to work with the data
