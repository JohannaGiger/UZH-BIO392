 What is CNV/CNA?
 CNV: copy number variation
 CNA: copy number aberration
 structural genome variations
 used to characterize molecular subtypes
 
How will you describe or introduce progenetix?
It is a resource that is accessible by the public. Its goal is to represent all different cancer profiles
-scale: 138'663 (115'357 tumor) copy number variation profiles
-data source: publications based on molecular cytogenetics and sequencing
ArrayExpresss (3887 samples), cBioPortal (19'712 samples), TCGA, GEO
-cancer types
-which information does it provide: profiles and their metadata, services to work with the data

Describe NCIt, UBERON codes, and their relationships.
National Cancer Institute Thesaurus: describes different cancer types, hierarchical ontology that is developed dynamically
UBERON: ontology system based on cross-species anatomical structures. It allows queries that link different databases, link different organs within the same organism and between model animals and humans. 
They connected ICD-O T (Interational Classification of Diseases in Oncology) codes to UBERON terms. 

What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them?

What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?
Application programming interface (GA4GH Beacon)
This is the interface that allows the users to give in queries and extract data. The user can enter start and end position range, filter for cancer type, location in the tissue, morphology, cell line or geographic location. 

How does progenetix visualize CNA profiles?
Can customize visualization

What do you think should be improved in progenetix?
