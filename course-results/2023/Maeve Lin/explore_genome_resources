Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium: It is a web interface that combines and interprets six different
knowledgebases. This is necessary because each knowledgebase is different in terms of content, structure and 
literature. This leads to problems when trying to make inferences between patient cohorts and clinical
significance. Hence, there is a need for sharing of data and making the different databases compatible. 
They combine data from following knowledgebases:
* Cancer Genome Interpreter Cancer Biomarkers Database (CGI)
* Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC)
* Jackson Laboratory Clinical Knowledgebase (JAX-CKB)
* MolecularMatch (MMatch)
* OncoKB
* Precision Medicine Knowledgebase (PMKB)

The standard and guidelines are based on the recommendations by AMP/ASCO/CAP.
