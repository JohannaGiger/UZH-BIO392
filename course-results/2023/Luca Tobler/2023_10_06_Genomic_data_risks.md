# Genomic data risks

As genomic sequencing has become more widespread and the scientific unterstanding of how to interpret genome data is continuing to increase, it is becoming increasingly clear of how widespread the possible applications for this technology are. Many of these applications have the possibility to make a positive impact for our society, especially when it comes to personalized medicine and in scientific research, where our understanding of individual patients as well as the human body as a whole greatly profits from this development. However, there is also a considerable risk of missuse of this data, as it is deeply personal. There are several aspects of genomic data that make its storage and processing a privacy nightmare. Every time someone has their genome sequenced, they do not only make their own DNA available, but provide insight on the DNA of their family and relatives, without their consent. This means that relatively few people need to take DNA tests before a relatively comprehensive database with information about everyones genome could be created. Combined with the fact that an individuals genome practically does not change over the course of their lifetime, means that this information only needs to be collected once to create a comprehensive database for an entire generation of people. We are now in an early phase of this development, but we already see hundreds of thousands of people consenting to having their genomes sequenced and stored in databases. I do not believe that this development can be stopped before adequate public awareness can be achieved, and I therefore assume that in the near future genomic information about most people will be "out there". The non-changing aspect of genomic information is significant, because it sets this question apart from other privacy debates, since those require a more constant data collection. Once such a database exists, it will be irrevokably available for parties of interest.

In March of 2023, the [Washington post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/03/19/us-companies-mass-dna-collection-tibet/) on how China is already collecting genomic data of their citizens - particularly Tibetians and Uyghurs. According to Human Rights watch, this is happening without the consent of the people tested. The collected data is used among other things to immediately identify anyone and their relatives who runs afoul of the CCP, which also works to silence activists abroad.

While the situation in China is particularly extreme, the miss-use of genomic data effects citizens of western democracies as well. In North America, police increasingly use DNA data bases to identify criminals, and insurance companies around the world show great interest in using this data to decide who to insure and exactly how high their premiums should be. As stated above, I do not believe that we can stop population-wide collection of genomes, and I therefore believe that the most important thing going forward is to strictly regulate how this information can be used and by whom. To strike a delicate balance between protecting individual privacy and enabling valuable research and advancements in healthcare, comprehensive regulations are essential.

Firstly, informed consent must be a cornerstone of genomic data usage. Individuals should have a clear understanding of how their data will be used, and their consent should be obtained in a transparent and understandable manner. Also, strict penalties should be in place for entities that misuse or mishandle genomic data, deterring any potential abuse. Secondly, data anonymization protocols should be reinforced. Personal identifiers must be removed from genomic datasets, ensuring that individuals cannot be directly identified. Implementing encryption standards and secure storage methods can add an extra layer of protection, safeguarding the data from cyber threats. Thirdly, limited access controls should be established. Only authorized researchers and institutions with valid, ethically approved research projects should be granted access to genomic databases. Implementing a tiered access system, where different levels of access are granted based on the sensitivity of the data, can ensure that sensitive information is only accessible to those with the highest level of clearance. Additionally, there should be strict guidelines for international data sharing, preventing genomic information from being transferred to countries or organizations with lax privacy regulations. International agreements and standards can help in harmonizing the rules governing genomic data usage globally.

Lastly, public awareness and education programs are crucial. Society must be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with genomic data sharing. Empowered individuals are more likely to make informed decisions about participating in genetic studies, ensuring that their rights and privacy are protected.
