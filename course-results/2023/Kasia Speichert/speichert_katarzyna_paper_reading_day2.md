## What is CNV/CNA?
Copy number aberrations repesent the frequent structural genome variations which are responsible 
for cancer development.

## Progenetix 

The Progenetix project is a cancer genome data resource which represents individual cancer CNA profiles together with associated metada from a broad range of oncogenomic studies and data repositories. Progenetix was first established in 2001 when it focused on data from chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) studies and with the time it incorporated data from molecular cytogenetics and sequencing experiments leading to the representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 copy number variation (CNV) profiles. Containing data of 834 different cancer types, the Progenetix aims to analyse different cancer biologies.
