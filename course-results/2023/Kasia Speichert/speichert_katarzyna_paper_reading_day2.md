## What is CNV/CNA?
Copy number aberrations repesent the frequent structural genome variations which are responsible 
for cancer development.

## Progenetix 

The Progenetix project is a cancer genome data resource which represents individual cancer CNA profiles together with associated metada from a broad range of oncogenomic studies and data repositories. Progenetix was first established in 2001 when it focused on data from chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) studies and with the time it incorporated data from molecular cytogenetics and sequencing experiments leading to the representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 copy number variation (CNV) profiles. Containing data of 834 different cancer types, the Progenetix aims to analyse different cancer biologies. 

## NCIt, ICOD, and UBERON

ICOD which stands for ‘International Classification of Diseases in Oncology’ is used by Progenetix to classify the cancer sample. It codes based on the Morphology and Topography with high specificity but unlike NCIt, it is limited with hierarchical concepts. NCIt is a hierarchical ontology which is able to transfer between classification systems and resources. 

>In the recent Progenetix update, we performed a data-driven generation of ICD-O—NCIt mappings and added the derived NCIt codes to all (existing and new) samples (mapping available through GitHub repository ‘progenetix/ICDOntologies’; manuscript in preparation), to take advantage of NCIt’s hierarchical structure for data retrieval, analysis and exchange

In contrast to ICDO which provides organ- and substructure-specific mapping, UBERON is the other anatomica structural ontology system which links multiple databases and describes logic query within the same organism and between model animals and humans.
