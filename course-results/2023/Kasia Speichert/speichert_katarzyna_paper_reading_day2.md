## What is CNV/CNA?
Copy number aberrations repesent the frequent structural genome variations which are responsible 
for cancer development.

## Progenetix 

>The Progenetix project, initiated in 2001, curates individual cancer CNA profiles and associated 
>metadata from published oncogenomic studies and data repositories with the aim to empower integrative 
>analyses spanning all different cancer biologies. During the last few years, the fields of genomics and 
>cancer research have seen significant advancement in terms of molecular genetics technology, disease 
>concepts, data standard harmonization as well as data availability, in an increasingly structured and 
>systematic manner. For the Progenetix resource, continuous data integration, curation and maintenance 
>have resulted in the most comprehensive representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 
>(including 115 357 tumor) copy number variation (CNV) profiles.


Progenetix is a publicly accessible cancer genome data resource (progenetix.org) that aims to provide 
a comprehensive representation of genomic variation profiles in cancer, through providing 
sample-specific CNA profiles and associated metadata as well as services related to data annotation, 
meta-analysis and visualization. Originally established in 2001 with a focus on data from chromosomal 
Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) studies (3), the resource has progressively incorporated data 
from hundreds of publications reporting on genome profiling experiments based on molecular cytogenetics 
(CGH, genomic arrays) and sequencing (whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing—WGS or WES).
