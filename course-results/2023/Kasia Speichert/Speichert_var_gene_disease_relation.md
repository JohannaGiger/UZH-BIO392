|-------|-------------------|----|--------|
|Hemochromatosis|a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet|HJV|NM_213653.4:c.187C>T|
|Thalassemia|a disease of the red blood cells in which hemoglobin is not formed sufficiently|ATRX|NM_000489.6:c.6253C>T|
|Haemophilia|a disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, a process needed to stop bleeding|F9|NM_000133.4:c.1113C>A|
|Cystic Fibrosis|a disorder that damages your lungs, digestive tract and other organs;the mucus in various organs becomes thick and sticky|CFTR|NM_000492.4:c.3623del|
|Tay sachs disease|a disease caused by the absence of an enzyme that helps break down fatty substances, called gangliosides, which build up to toxic levels in the brain and spinal cord and affect the function of the nerve cells|HEXA|NM_000520.6:c.1385A>T|
|Fragile X syndrome|a disease which causes a wide range of physical, developmental, behavioural and emotional difficulties|COL1A1|NM_000088.4:c.934C>T|
|Huntington's disease|a rare, inherited disease that causes the progressive breakdown (degeneration) of nerve cells in the brain. It has a wide impact on a person's functional abilities and usually results in movement, thinking (cognitive) and psychiatric disorders.|PRNP|NM_000311.5:c.593T>C|
