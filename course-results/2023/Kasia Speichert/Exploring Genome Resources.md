# Primary deposition databases
1) Cancer Genome Interpreter Cancer Biomarkers Database (CGI)
2) Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC)
3) Jackson Laboratory Clinical Knowledgebase (JAX-CKB)
4) MolecularMatch (MMatch)
5) ncoKB
6) Precision Medicine Knowledgebase (PMKB)

Interoperability and automated aggregation are required to make a comprehensive approach to cancer precision medicine tractable and to establish consensus across knowledgebases.
The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) is as an international cooperative project to accelerate the development of approaches for responsible, voluntary and secure sharing of genomic and clinical data. 
The Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC) is a consortium of clinical variant interpretation experts addressing the challenges of representing and sharing curated interpretations across the cancer research community.
