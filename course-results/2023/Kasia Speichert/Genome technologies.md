# General NGS technologies 

Next generation sequencing is a much more powerful technique to sequence DNA in a massive and parallel manner. Can be performed on a much greater scale than Sanger sequencing. 

# Count based vs intensity based as principle


# Long and short read technologies

# Cytogenetic techniqes (usage, research, clinical, historical vs current)

## Banding analysis

## SNP, aCGH arrays

## Chromosomal CGH

# "T2T" genome

## What technologies enable this?
