The generation of genomic data has become increasingly important in various fields such as healthcare, research, and personal genetics. Not only come they from functional genomics 
data obtained by next-generation sequencing (NGS) which increased greatly in the past decade but also from the commercial databases which gather DNA data from at-home tests, which aim to 
find out genetic ancestry, disease predisposition or inherited traits. While broad sharing of NGS data is essential for research advancement it poses privacy challenges, with the commercial 
database representing an even more substantial risk.
