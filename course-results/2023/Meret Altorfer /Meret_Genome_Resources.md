# Task Exploring Genome Resources
make some notes about different genome resources and thier primary use

## Human Genome Resources at NCIB
- Reference Genome: Possibility to download the reference human genome assembly in various formats (for example FASTA). 
- Genetic Variation:  access data related to genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and structural variations in the human genome
-  Sequencing Data: links to sequence data archives 
- Tools and Software: tools and software resources for analyzing and working with human genome data (e.g. ClinVar aggregates information about genomic variation and its relationship to human health)

##  UCSC Genome Browser
- Species Tree and connected assembly hubs => of different species, also the sequences are available
- genome visualisation of  genomic data, such as DNA sequences, gene annotations, and other genomic features (zoom in option)
Different tools to use:
- **BLAT** (BLAST-Like Alignment Tool: very fast sequence alignment tool similar to BLAST  (http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start)
- **In-Silico PCR** searches a sequence database with a pair of PCR primers, using an indexing strategy for fast performance

## Clinical Genome Resource: ClinGen
- Variant Interpretation: ClinGen provides guidelines and resources for the interpretation of genomic variants => important for diagnosing genetic disorders and assessing disease risk
