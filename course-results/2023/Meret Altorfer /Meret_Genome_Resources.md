# Task Exploring Genome Resources
make some notes about different genome resources and thier primary use

## Human Genome Resources at NCIB
- Reference Genome: Possibility to download the reference human genome assembly in various formats (for example FASTA). 
- Genetic Variation:  access data related to genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and structural variations in the human genome
-  Sequencing Data: links to sequence data archives 
- Tools and Software: tools and software resources for analyzing and working with human genome data (e.g. ClinVar aggregates information about genomic variation and its relationship to human health)
