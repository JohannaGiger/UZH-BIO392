# Estimate Storage Requirements for 1000 Genomes

## Storage/Costs for 1000 Genomes
For each base (TCGA) only 2 bits of storage are needed, therefore a genome with 3 billion bases needs 6 billion bits (0.75GB) to be stored. Consequently, 
1000 genomes need 1000*6’000’000’000b storage this is about 750GB.  (Slides)
