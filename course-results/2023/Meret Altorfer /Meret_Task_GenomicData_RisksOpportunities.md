-  A co-founder of Genomic Prediction has said, controversially, that people might eventually be able to select for traits that are unrelated to disease, such as intelligence.
-  ut testing for polygenic conditions (often referred to as PGT-P) is much newer, with only a small hand- ful of companies selling it in a few countries, including the United States and Brazil, where it is largely unregulated.
-  Researchers are also concerned that, in most cases, the genomic models behind these tests are too weak to predict disease risk in a mean- ingful way for a developing embryo.
-  Most diseases are considered polygenic â€” often linked to many different genes interacting with each other and their environment in complex ways.
