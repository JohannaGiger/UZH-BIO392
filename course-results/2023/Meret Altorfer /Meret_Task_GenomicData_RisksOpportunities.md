# Genomic Data Risks and Opportunities
## The Controversial Embryo Tests that Promise Healthier Baby

In April 2003 the [Human Genome Project](https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project#:~:text=Launched%20in%20October%201990%20and,improved%20the%20practice%20of%20medicine) generated the first sequence of the human genome) The Human Genome Project (HGP) is one of the greatest scientific feats in history. The project was a voyage of biological discovery led by an international group of researchers looking to comprehensively study all of the DNA (known as a genome) of a select set of organisms. Launched in October 1990 and completed in April 2003, the Human Genome Project’s signature accomplishment – generating the first sequence of the human genome – provided fundamental information about the human blueprint, which has since accelerated the study of human biology and improved the practice of medicine.

-  A co-founder of Genomic Prediction has said, controversially, that people might eventually be able to select for traits that are unrelated to disease, such as intelligence.
-  ut testing for polygenic conditions (often referred to as PGT-P) is much newer, with only a small hand- ful of companies selling it in a few countries, including the United States and Brazil, where it is largely unregulated.
-  Researchers are also concerned that, in most cases, the genomic models behind these tests are too weak to predict disease risk in a mean- ingful way for a developing embryo.
-  Most diseases are considered polygenic — often linked to many different genes interacting with each other and their environment in complex ways.
