# Course work: Questions of Genomic Data Risks & Opportunities

<!---
- a comment about your own stance regarding the use of your genome data for healthcare / lifestyle ... purposes (would you? where/when? limitations?)
- an example (e.g. w/ reference to an article or slide) that influenced or mirrors your opinion

Genetic Identification for crime solving:

- Millions of us have made our DNA available to companies like 23AndMe
- Since 2016, Chinese police have taken DNA from one-third of Tibetans, following mass DNA collection from Uyghurs facing genocide in Xinjiang
- This is most disturbing in the convergence of facial recognition and genetic testing
- We can and should ban the types of mass surveillance practices that allow police to run dragnet searches of an entire database—compromising the genetic privacy of millions—to maybe identify just one person


The controversial embryo tests that promise a better baby:

- His company offers tests based on a decade of research into ‘polygenic risk scores’, which calculate someone’s likelihood of getting a disease on the basis of the genetic contributions of hundreds, thousands or even millions of single DNA letter changes in the genome
- Genomic Prediction and some other companies have been using these scores to test embryos generated by in vitro fertilization (IVF)
- that people might eventually be able to select for traits that are unrelated to disease, such as intelligence
-  and researchers have since developed tests that screen embryos for chromosomal abnormalities and some monogenic conditions — those caused by a single defective gene, such as cystic fibrosis
-  MyOme, a company in Menlo Park, California, developed a technique that can reconstruct the full genome of such embryos with nearly complete accuracy — with the help of genome sequences from both parents

In their article on genetic identification for crime solving, The Daily Beast provides an overview of how this technique is currently employed by governments for various purposes[^1]. 
While genomic profiles have proven immensely useful, particularly in the realm of crime solving, the challenge lies in maintaining the boundary that limits their use primarily to this noble pursuit.

Notably, China has already collected one third of the Tibetan's, while American companies obtain data through individuals willingly exploring their ancestry. 
This results in the accumulation of vast amounts of data, the use of which is now entrusted to these companies and governments, offering both immense potential and substantial risks.

The biggest danger lies in the profiling of individuals, reaching unprecedented levels in history, possibly beginning even at the embryo's conception, significantly impacting the person's later life.
Indeed, embryos are already under investigation for genetic conditions such as cystic fibrosis or chromosomal abnormalities[^2]. 
However, with the rapid advancements in genetic sequencing and artificial intelligence, questions arise about the potential usage of future screening for traits beyond diseases, including unrelated factors like intelligence, as mentioned in Max Kozloff's article.

Despite the current stance on ethics in research preventing such screenings, it remains uncertain if this stance will persist. 
Given certain governments' extensive utilization of facial recognition technologies today, it is not challenging to envision their use of such databases for their own benefit.
Moreover, the creation of genetic profiles for individuals before birth could lead to insurance companies adjusting their pricing strategies, even for basic insurance.
After all, they are primarily motivated by economic interests. 
Raising prices for individuals with greater future risks could minimize their financial liabilities at the cost of the individuals under investigation.

The matter of consent to all this is critical, particularly since we are currently witnessing the establishment and population of these databases. 
Presently, it is relatively easy for an individual to decline inclusion in such a database. 
However, the interconnectedness of families means that even if a sibling, parent, or cousin consents to contribute their data, an individual's choice of consent is partially taken away.

Lastly, The Daily Beast's commentary on the convergence of facial recognition and genetic testing paints a grim future. 
This future envisions genetic profiles readily available to companies and governments, coupled with artificial intelligence capable of facial recognition for tracking individuals and potentially selecting traits during embryo formation.
Such a future would bear a striking resemblance to George Orwell's dystopian vision, and the idea of selecting certain traits and calling some traits more favourable than - or superior to others - has already appeared in the mid-20th century and hopefully this notion will not reappear anytime soon especially because diversity is such an important asset.

In conclusion, the use of genomic profiles in various facets of society, e.g. from crime solving to potential future applications, presents a double-edged sword.
While the technology offers benefits, such as advancing our understanding of genetic conditions, it also carries ethical and privacy concerns.
The fine line between the responsible use of genomic data and its potential misuse is becoming more and more challenging to discern. 
Only through a thoughtful approach can we strike a balance between technological progress and safeguarding our fundamental values and principles.
