# Task: Exploring Genome Resources




[Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html)

- Ensembl is a genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation   
- Ensembl annotate genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data   
- Ensembl tools include BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for all supported species  
- The primary use of the Ensembl database is to provide a centralized and comprehensive resource for genomic and genetic information for a wide range of species

[UCSC](http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/)

- The UCSC Genome Browser offers annotations for the genomes of numerous species, including the identification and annotation of genes, transcripts, regulatory elements, and other genomic features
- The browser allows users to compare multiple genomes from different species
- It provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to navigate, zoom in, and explore specific regions of genomes
- The primary use of the UCSC Genome Browser is to provide a web-based platform for visualizing and analyzing genomic data 

[ClinGen](https://clinicalgenome.org/) 

- ClinGen is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded resource dedicated to building a central resource that defines the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine and research
- Works to define the clinical relevance of genes by curating and assessing evidence for gene-disease associations
- Provides guidelines and resources for the interpretation of genomic variants, particularly those identified in clinical genetic testing
- ClinGen takes a broader gene-centric approach compared to ClinVar, emphasizing the clinical validity of genes and their associations with diseases
- The primary use is to improve our understanding of the clinical relevance of genes and genomic variants in human health 

[NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) 

- The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information
- NCBI hosts and maintains several important genomic databases, including GenBank (a repository of genetic sequences), RefSeq (a curated database of reference sequences), and dbSNP (a database of single nucleotide polymorphisms)
- NCBI provides access to PubMed, a vast database of biomedical literature 
- The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is a widely used sequence similarity search program provided by NCBI 
- The primary use is to provide access to a wide range of biological and genomic data, as well as tools and resources, to support biomedical research, genetics, genomics, and related fields

[NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) 

- The NHGRI is a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States, and it provides valuable resources and information related to genomics and genomic research
- The website provides educational materials, fact sheets, and resources to help the public, students, and researchers learn about genomics
- Information about how genomics is impacting medicine, including precision medicine initiatives, is available on the site
- The primary use is to serve as an authoritative source of information related to genomics and genomic research

[ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) 

- ClinVar collects and curates data on genetic variants associated with various diseases and conditions, including pathogenicity, and relevance to human health
- Provides valuable information for healthcare professionals to aid in making informed decisions about patient care
- Aids in studies related to genetics, genomics, and the development of new therapies or diagnostic tools for genetic diseases
- The primary use of ClinVar is to serve as a repository for information related to genetic variants and their clinical significance
