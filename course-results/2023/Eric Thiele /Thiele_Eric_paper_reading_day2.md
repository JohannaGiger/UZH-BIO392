## Question 1:
What is CNV/CNA ? 

- CNV short for Copy number variations occours if sequences of the genome are repeated and varry among individuals in
  their number of copies. This can happen due to duplications, deletions or other changes in the DNA. 

- CNA short for Copy number aberrations are a type of frequently and mostly heavy structural genome variation that
  majorly occours in cancer types and have a big impact on developing cancer. 


## Question 2:
How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on) ?

- Progenetix is a data bank that includes about 138'663 CNV profiles and is based on newer as also on older done projects (GEO, TCGA, cBioPortal and more array based datas or collections) that provides information in relation to specific cancer profiles with the help of CNA - profiles. It also simplifies handling with the datas and vizualisation for cancer specification. The scale for the cancer-types are rather big (Such as lung cancer, Gastrointestinal cancer types, Head and Neck cancer and many more).
  

## Question 3:
Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships. 

### They are all resources for helping to classify and identify specific cancer types with different focuses.

NCIt is a developed bioinformatic ontology that helps to create structure and overview out of a data bank for cancer research.

ICO-D is a classification system for diseases. ICD-O is limited in its representation of hierarchical concepts. Translation to modern ontologies is complexer than for the others.

UBERON

While the ICD-O is focused on a   organ- and substructure-specific way to clearify cancer formation as itself UBERON is more focused on cross species anatomical structure ontology and linking databases with protein ontology 



Question 4:
What are CNV segmantations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them ?

Question 5: 
What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?

Question 6:
How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?

Question 7:
What do you think should be improved in progenetix?
