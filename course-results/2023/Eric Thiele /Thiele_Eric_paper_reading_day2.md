## Question 1:
What is CNV/CNA ? 

- CNV short for Copy number variations occours if sequences of the genome are repeated and varry among individuals in
  their number of copies. This can happen due to duplications, deletions or other changes in the DNA. 

- CNA short for Copy number aberrations are a type of frequently and mostly heavy structural genome variation that
  majorly occours in cancer types and have a big impact on developing cancer. 


## Question 2:
How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on) ?

- Progenetix is a data bank that includes about 138'663 CNV profiles and is based on newer as also on older done projects (GEO, TCGA, cBioPortal and more array based datas or collections) that provides information in relation to specific cancer profiles with the help of CNA - profiles. It also simplifies handling with the data and vizualisation for cancer specification. The scale for the cancer-types are rather big (Such as lung cancer, Gastrointestinal cancer types, Head and Neck cancer and many more).
  

## Question 3:
Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships. 

They are all resources for helping to classify and identify specific cancer types and other health conditions with different focuses.

- NCIt is a developed bioinformatic ontology that helps to create structure and overview out of a data bank for cancer research.

- ICO-D is a classification system for diseases and is limited in its representation of hierarchical concepts. Translation to modern ontologies is complexer than for the others.

- While the ICD-O is focused on a organ- and substructure-specific way to clearify cancer formation as itself UBERON is more focused on cross species anatomical structure ontology and linking databases with protein
  ontology.



## Question 4:
What are CNV segmantations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them ?

- In CNV segmentation, the genome in which the copy number deviates from the standard diploid state is divided into segments with different copy numbers. Various algorithms are used to identify CNV segments in the genome based on databases.

- CNV frequencies represent the prevalence or occurrence of certain copy number variations within a population or data set and provide information about genetic diversity and population structure among individuals or groups.

- CNV segmentation can be used to identify CNVs associated with certain cancer types.
- CNV frequencies tell us more about the genetic diversity in a group or studied population.  

## Question 5: 
What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?

- Application Programming Interfaces help to handle different kinds of metadata and experimental outcomes to get a representable connection of physical source of the data and the logical genotyping information and adapts
  to various scenarios for data aggregation and analysis.

- Basicaly Progenetix resources provides an extensive collection of oncogenomic data with a focus on individual genome-wide CNA profiles and also includes genomic profiling experiments using in vitro models. APIs help to
  get requests of start and end position range with filter options for cancer type, tissue location, morphology, cell line or geographic location. There some additional features that can help to save time in working with
  Progenetix. 

## Question 6:
How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?

- Progenetix provide you plenty of informations that also can be filtered, altough for visualisation is the genome-wide CNA displayed on the 'Result' page as a percentage of samples with yellow denoting CN gain and blue 
 denoting CN loss. 

## Question 7:
What do you think should be improved in progenetix?

- It is difficult to say what should be improved without working experience with progenetix, but I could imagine that an increase in the amount of data with constant updates to the newest studies and latest findings could
  help for a better and more accurate work.

- Boolean options to chain filters and thus allow to create diverse and nuanced search queries to get the desired results.

- Continuously maintain and expand a stable API for progenetix for the inclusion of newer projects and data types. 

- And on the other side ensure a safe environment in relationship to data privacy ans security to protect sensitive genomic informations.
