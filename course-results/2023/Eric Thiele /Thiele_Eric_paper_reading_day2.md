## Question 1:
What is CNV/CNA ? 

- CNV short for Copy number variations occours if sequences of the genome are repeated and varry among individuals in
  their number of copies. This can happen due to duplications, deletions or other changes in the DNA. 

- CNA short for Copy number aberrations are a type of frequently and mostly heavy structural genome variation that
  majorly occours in cancer types and have a big impact on developing cancer. 


## Question 2:
How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on) ?

- Progenetix is a data bank that is based on newer as also on older done projects (such as TCGA, cBioPortal and data collections that provides
  information in relation to specific cancer profiles with the help
  of CNA - profiles. It also simplifies handling with the datas and vizualisation for cancer specifications.
  

## Question 3:
Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships. 

Question 4:
What are CNV segmantations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them ?

Question 5: 
What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?

Question 6:
How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?

Question 7:
What do you think should be improved in progenetix?
