## 1. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition
# Use / Advantages  

   - ICD-10 provides a comprehensive and detailed coding system
     clinical use
   - ICD-10 is used globally, making it easier to exchange health
     information and statistics between countries
   - ICD-10 is a comprehensive system used for classifying
     diseases and health conditions, not limited to cancer.


     
#Problems

- The detailed nature of ICD-10 increases the potential for coding errors

## 2.  International Classification of Diseases for Oncology
# Use / Advantages
   -  is a specialized coding system used for classifying and coding neoplasms (tumors) and related conditions
   -  Researchers use ICD-O codes to study cancer, track cancer incidence, and analyze treatment outcomes
   -  ICD-O coding is essential in clinical practice for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of cancer patients

# Problems

- In some clinical settings, the level of detail provided by ICD-O may
  not be necessary, leading to potential overcomplication of coding
- Complex coding systems like ICD-O increase the risk of coding errors,
  which can have significant implications for patient care, treatment planning, and research


## 3. The National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCIt)
 
# Use / Advantages

  - NCIt is a biomedical ontology and controlled vocabulary system developed by the
    National Cancer Institute (NCI) specifically for cancer-related terminology and concepts
  - It plays a significant role in cancer research, clinical care, and data management.
  - It provides a common language for researchers
    to describe and categorize cancer-related information
  - Integration of data from various sources, such as electronic health records and clinical trials, using NCIt codes.
 
# Problems 

-  Like many controlled vocabularies, NCIt may have terms with varying interpretations,
   which can lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
