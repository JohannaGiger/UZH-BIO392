# Ensembl

- Ensembl is a genome annotation resource that provides information about the structure,
  function, and regulation of genes in various species.


# NCBI dbSNP 

- NCBI's dbSNP database is a comprehensive database that catalogues single nucleotide
- polymorphisms (SNPs) and other small genetic variations in various organisms, with a
  focus on humans.


# ExAC 

- ExAC is a tool that compiles exome sequencing data from numerous individuals to create a
  a comprehensive catalogue of genomic diversity.


# NCBI:dbVAR

- NCBI:dbVAR is primarily used for documenting data on genomic structural variants (SVs)
  in many organisms, including humans.
  Features include inserts, deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations,
  and many other types of structural variation data. The genomic locations,
  breakpoints, size, and genetic context of these changes are all given in great detail.
