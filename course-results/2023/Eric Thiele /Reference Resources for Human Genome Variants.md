# Ensembl

- Ensembl is a genome annotation resource that provides information about the structure,
  function, and regulation of genes in various species.


# NCBI dbSNP 

- NCBI's dbSNP database is a comprehensive database that catalogues single nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) and other small genetic variations in various organisms, with a
  focus on humans.


# ExAC 

- ExAC is a tool that compiles exome sequencing data from numerous individuals to create a
  a comprehensive catalogue of genomic diversity.


# NCBI:dbVAR

- NCBI:dbVAR is primarily used for documenting data on genomic structural variants (SVs)
  in many organisms, including humans.
  Features include inserts, deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations,
  and many other types of structural variation data. The genomic locations,
  breakpoints, size, and genetic context of these changes are all given in great detail.


# NCBI:ClinVar

- includes a significant amount of information on genomic variations, including
  copy number variations (CNVs), structural changes, insertions, deletions,
  and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). It provides thorough details on the pathogenicity,
  clinical interpretation, and related diseases or conditions for these variations.


# EMBL-EBI European Variation Archive (EVA):

- EVA focuses on collecting and preserving data on genetic variations in a variety
  of species, including humans and model organisms, and making these data accessible.
  EVA provides detailed information on genomic locations, allele frequencies,
  and functional observations for these variants.
