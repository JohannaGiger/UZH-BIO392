# Ensembl

- Ensembl is a genome annotation resource that provides information about the structure,
  function, and regulation of genes in various species.


# NCBI dbSNP 

- NCBI's dbSNP database is a comprehensive database that catalogues single nucleotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs) and other small genetic variations in various organisms, with a
  focus on humans.


# ExAC 

- ExAC is a tool that aggregates exome sequencing data from numerous individuals
  to create a comprehensive catalogue of genomic diversity.

# NCBI:dbVAR

- NCBI:dbVAR is primarily used for documenting data on genomic structural variants (SVs)
  in many organisms, including humans.
  Features include inserts, deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations,
  and many other types of structural variation data. The genomic locations,
  breakpoints, size, and genetic context of these changes are all given in great detail.


# NCBI:ClinVar

- includes a significant amount of information on genomic variations, including
  copy number variations (CNVs), structural changes, insertions, deletions,
  and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). It provides thorough details on the pathogenicity,
  clinical interpretation, and related diseases or conditions for these variations.


# EMBL-EBI European Variation Archive (EVA):

- EVA focuses on collecting and preserving data on genetic variations in a variety
  of species, including humans and model organisms, and making these data accessible.
  EVA provides detailed information on genomic locations, allele frequencies,
  and functional observations for these variants.


# UCSC Genome Browser:

- The UCSC Genomic Browser provides an interactive platform for viewing and
  analyzing genomic sequences. It provides an intuitive user interface with
  a variety of genome-related data tracks, such as gene structure and function, regulatory elements,
  and comparative genomics information.


# 1000 Genomes Project

- The goal of the 1000 Genomes Project was to sequence the genomes of a large number of people
  from different populations to create a comprehensive catalogue of human genetic variation.
  It features such details as genetic variation, including single nucleotide polymorphisms
  (SNPs) and structural variants.
