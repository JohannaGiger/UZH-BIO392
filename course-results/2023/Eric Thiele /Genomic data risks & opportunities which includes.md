## Genome Data Risks: Navigating the Path of Genetic Knowledge

Our knowledge of genetics has grown at a time when science and technology are developing at an astounding rate, 
enabling us to discover the mysteries buried in the very foundation of our existence. But with this new understanding 
also comes a significant worry: the risks and opportunities of genetic information.

The core idea is to create a phenotype from a single DNA nucleotide along the length of the entire genome. 
However, displaying the phenotype is only one part of what is involved. It also involves among other areas,
identifying illness development risks, criminology-related investigation possibilities or hereditary backgrounds. 

Personally, I am of the opinion that G2P holds great promise for both the broad representation of the phenotype
based on nucleotide sequences and the identification of people. 
As stated in the New York Times article "I've Just Seen a (DNA-Generated) Face," computer programs that can depict faces
only based on genetic sequences are currently quite advanced. I'm still considering the relationship between epigenetics
and lifestyle. Since these can greatly affect phenotypic, it is nearly impossible to accurately describe the effective face.
Despite all of this, it is already possible to create a fairly accurate facial profile that is also instructive in terms of criminology.

- Epigenetic, Lifestyle spricht dem entgegen 
- Krimminalität, grosse Hilfe aber kann gut vorstellen dass man über andere legalere Wege auch sehr
