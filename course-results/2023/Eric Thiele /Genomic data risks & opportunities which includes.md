## Genome Data Risks: Navigating the Path of Genetic Knowledge

Our knowledge of genetics has grown at a time when science and technology are developing at an astounding rate, 
enabling us to discover the mysteries buried in the very foundation of our existence. But with this new understanding 
also comes a significant worry: the risks and opportunities of genetic information.
