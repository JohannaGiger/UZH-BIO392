## Genome Data Risks: Navigating the Path of Genetic Knowledge

Our knowledge of genetics has grown at a time when science and technology are developing at an astounding rate, 
enabling us to discover the mysteries buried in the very foundation of our existence. But with this new understanding 
also comes a significant worry: the risks and opportunities of genetic information.

The core idea is to create a phenotype from a single DNA nucleotide along the length of the entire genome. 
However, displaying the phenotype is only one part of what is involved. It also involves among other areas,
identifying illness development risks, criminology-related investigation possibilities or hereditary backgrounds. 

With the analysis of the genome and the subsequent detection of SNPs and CNVs, there is a good chance that the risk
of developing specific diseases may be determined. 

Personally, I am of the opinion that G2P holds great promise for both the broad representation of the phenotype
based on nucleotide sequences and the identification of people. 
As stated in the New York Times articleÂ "I've Just Seen a (DNA-Generated) Face," computer programs that can depict faces
only based on genetic sequences are currently quite advanced. I'm still considering the relationship between epigenetics
and lifestyle. Since these can greatly affect phenotypic, it is nearly impossible to describe the effective face accurately.
Despite all of this, it is already possible to create a fairly accurate facial profile that is instructive in criminology. 

On the other hand, it also poses a serious risk to privacy, even though one could view it as a double-edged sword. 
For instance, if the focus is on personalized medicine, which theorizes that one can prescribe specific medications
for each patient based on the analysis of their genetic data and the development of individualized, optimal treatment,
this will have a significant positive impact on the treatment of disease, but will also require a significant intrusion into their personal data.
On the other hand, one must be able to commit to a very high level of confidentiality, ensuring that one deals with these data
responsibly and that they are stored in a secure manner to prevent hacking.
