# Task: Estimate Storage Requirements for 1000 Genomes

WGS also called "Whole genome sequencing" is the process, in which 
you try to get the DNA nucleotide sequence of the whole genome, which includes the whole chromosomal DNA and mitochondrial. 
One of the first aproaches was the capillary sequencing methode. With this method it was possible to nearly sequencethe whole genome but 
the problem was that is was to expensive and wasn't efficient enough for commercial purposes. 
Over the time the nanopore - sequencing technology became more prevalent due to the fact that it is much quicker and can sequence 
overall longer sequences. The only disadvantage is that it is less accurate. 
Methods for analyzing sequencing data are leading to a better understanding of diseases and target their prevention.

# BAM (Binary Alignment Map) 

BAM is the compressed binary version of a SAM file and has the specific benefit of finding overlapping locations quickly.
Its format allows a very compact saving and is faster to read and write compared to their text-based counterpart, the SAM file.
Bam files are divided into a header and alignments. 
The header contains the sample name, sample length, and the alignment method. Meanwhile, the alignments part contains the read name,
sequence, quality, alignment information and custom tags. 
Chromosome, start coordinate, alignment quality and match descriptor string can then be found under the read name.
