| Hemochromatosis   | A disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet    |  HJV    | NM_213656.4:c.187C>T   |
|Thalassemia    | Thalassaemia is a hereditary disease caused by an imbalance in the formation of the four amino acid chains in the haemoglobin      | ATRX       | NM_000489.6:c.6253C>T      |
| Cystic Fibrosis     | Cystic fibrosis make thick, sticky mucus that can build up and lead to blockages, damage, or infections in the affected organs, due to a faulty protein       | CFTR       | NM_000492.4:c.3623del      |
| Tay sachs disease    | Due to the lack of an enzyme that actually supports the breakdown of fatty substances, fatty substances accumulate in toxic quantities in the brain and spinal cord and impair the function of the nerve cells.       | HEXA      | NM_000520.6:c.1385A>T       |
| Fragile X syndrome     | A disease that manifests itself in delayed development, reduced intelligence, learning difficulties, behavioural problems, seizures and external features       |  COL1A1      | NM_000088.4:c.934C>T    |

| CFTR         |     CF transmembrane conductance regulator     |          7q31.2 |         epithlial ion channel. transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane  |          cystic fribrosis |         a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity  |
| CYBB         |     cytochrome b-245 beta chain      |          Xp21.1-p11.4 |        Component of the membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes, which produces superoxides. Important component in the respiratory chain that transfers single electrons from cytoplasmic NADPH across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen on the outside |         X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGDX) |         Immunodeficiency in which symptoms appear in the first months or years of life. The disease is characterised by recurrent infections, lymphadenopathy, inflammatory bowel disease, fever or skin infections.  |
| HJV         |     hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor      |          1q21.1 |         Represents a coreceptor for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), regulates hepcidin expression and controls iron homeostasis.  |          Hemochromatosis type 2A |         Haemochromatosis type 2 is a disease characterised by an excessive accumulation of iron in the body. When there is an accumulation of iron, which is toxic, organ damage can occur.  |
| CDKN2A         |     cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A      |          9p21.3 |         Acts as a negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by strongly interacting with CDK4 and CDK6. The interaction with cyclin D is thereby inhibited.  |          Melonoma  |      Melonoma is a highly malignant tumour of the pigment cells   |
| KRAS         |     KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase      |          12p12.1 |         Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and thereby possess intrinsic GTPase activity. Plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation and promoting oncogenic events.  |          Noonan syndrome |         Noonan syndrome is a genetic defect that causes a number of physical abnormalities, including short stature, growth hormone deficiency in children or heart defects.  |
| TP53          |     tumor protein p53      |          17p13.1 |         acts as a tumour suppressor in many tumour types and triggers growth arrest or apoptosis depending on and cell type.  |          Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1 |         Li-Fraumeni syndrome, or LFS is a tumour predisposition syndrome. It occurs predominantly in children and adolescents who develop multiple tumours as part of the disease. The adrenal glands, soft tissues, bones and mammary gland are particularly affected.  |
| FMR1         |      fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1      |          Xq27.3 |         Multifunctional polyribosome-associated RNA-binding protein that plays a central role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity through the regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA dendritic transport and postsynaptic local protein synthesis of a subset of mRNA  |          Fragile X syndrome |         a genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability  |
