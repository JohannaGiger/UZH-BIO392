| Hemochromatosis   | A disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet    |  HJV    | NM_213656.4:c.187C>T   |
|Thalassemia    | Thalassaemia is a hereditary disease caused by an imbalance in the formation of the four amino acid chains in the haemoglobin      | ATRX       | NM_000489.6:c.6253C>T      |
| Cystic Fibrosis     | Cystic fibrosis make thick, sticky mucus that can build up and lead to blockages, damage, or infections in the affected organs, due to a faulty protein       | CFTR       | NM_000492.4:c.3623del      |
| Tay sachs disease    | Due to the lack of an enzyme that actually supports the breakdown of fatty substances, fatty substances accumulate in toxic quantities in the brain and spinal cord and impair the function of the nerve cells.       | HEXA      | NM_000520.6:c.1385A>T       |
| Fragile X syndrome     | A disease that manifests itself in delayed development, reduced intelligence, learning difficulties, behavioural problems, seizures and external features       |  COL1A1      | NM_000088.4:c.934C>T    |
| Â Huntington's disease    | Huntington's disease is a condition that damages nerve cells in the brain and can affect movement  and mental health      | PRNP    | NM_000311.5:c.593T>C     |

| CFTR         |     CF transmembrane conductance regulator     |          7q31.2 |         epithlial ion channel. transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane  |          cystic fribrosis |         a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity  |
| CYBB         |     cytochrome b-245 beta chain      |          Xp21.1-p11.4 |         Critical component of the membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes that generates superoxide. It is the terminal component of a respiratory chain that transfers single electrons from cytoplasmic NADPH across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen on the exterior  |          granulomatous disease, chronic, X-linked |         ...  |
| HJV         |     hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor      |          1q21.1 |         Acts as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor. Through enhancement of BMP signaling regulates hepcidin (HAMP) expression and regulates iron homeostasis.  |          hemochromatosis type 2A |         ...  |
| CDKN2A         |     cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A      |          9p21.3 |         Acts as a negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by interacting strongly with CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibits their ability to interact with cyclins D and to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein.  |          melonoma  |         ...  |
| KRAS         |     KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase      |          12p12.1 |         Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity . Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation. Plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in a ZNF304-dependent manner .   |          Noonan syndrome |         :---  |
| TP53          |     tumor protein p53      |          17p13.1 |         Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type.  |          Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1 |         ...  |
| FMR1         |      fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1      |          Xq27.3 |         Multifunctional polyribosome-associated RNA-binding protein that plays a central role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity through the regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA dendritic transport and postsynaptic local protein synthesis of a subset of mRNA  |          Fragile X syndrome |         a genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability  |
