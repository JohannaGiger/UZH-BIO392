# NCBI: National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/)
human genome resource
provides refrence sequences for different applications (eg. dbSNP, dbVAR..)
GRCh38 & GRCh37

## NCBI:dbSNP
single nucleotide polymorphisms
central repository for both single base nucleotide subsitutions and short deletion and insertion polymorphisms -> database of small-scale sequence variations
developed because SNPs are expected to facilitate large-scale association genetics studies
no requirement or assumption about allel frequency
## NCBI:dbVAR
database of genomic structural variation
## NCBI:ClinVar
Information about genomic variation and its relationship to human health
relationship among human variations and phenotypes (-> health status)
HGVS standard


## EMBL-EBI:EVA
European Variation Archive 
all types of genetic variations
all species
data can be downloaded or submitted
query variants by study, gene, chromosomal location, dSNP
