# NCBI: National Center for Biotechnology Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/)

human genome resource

provides refrence sequences for different applications (eg. dbSNP, dbVAR..)

GRCh38 & GRCh37

## NCBI:dbSNP
single nucleotide polymorphisms

central repository for both single base nucleotide subsitutions and short deletion and insertion 

polymorphisms -> database of small-scale sequence variations

developed because SNPs are expected to facilitate large-scale association genetics studies

no requirement or assumption about allel frequency
## NCBI:dbVAR
database of genomic structural variation
## NCBI:ClinVar
Information about genomic variation and its relationship to human health

relationship among human variations and phenotypes (-> health status)

HGVS standard

## EMBL-EBI:EVA
European Variation Archive 

all types of genetic variations

all species

data can be downloaded or submitted

query variants by study, gene, chromosomal location, dSNP

(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/)


# ENSEMBL
vertebrate genoms

comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation, transcriptional regulation

annotates genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function, collects disease data

BLAST, BLAT, BioMart, VEP

# COSMIC
Catalogue of somatatic mutations in cancer

used to explore the effect of somatic mutations in human cancer

search types include: gene, cancer type, mutation
