Question 1: What is CNV/CNA?
CNA: copy number aberrations
  they represent a type of nearly ubiquitous and frequently extensive structural genome variations ( rewrite )!
CNV : copy number variation

Question 2: How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)

progenetix is publicly accessible

the progenetix project organizes and presents individual cancer CNA profiles, as well as metadata from oncogenomic studies and data repositories.
the goal is to make inegrative analyses spanning all diffrent cancer biologies possible and to provide a comprehensive representation of genomic variation profiles in cancer

scale: 138663 (including 115357 tumor) copy number variation profiles
data source: chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), hunderds of publications reporting on genompe profiling experiments based on molecular cytogenetics (CGH, genomic arrarys) and sequencing (WGS or WES), complete incororation of arrayMap data collection, datasets from external resources and projects (eg. The Cancer Genome Atlas TCGA, cBioPortal) and recurrent collection and re-processing of array-based data from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)'s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute  (EMBL-EBI)'s ArrayExpress.

Integration with projects of the Global alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and ELIXIR






Question 3: Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships

Question 4: What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them?

Question 5: What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix

Question 6 : How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?

Question 7: What do you think shloud be imporved in progenetix
