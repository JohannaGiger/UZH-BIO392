### **Genomic Resources**

-   [**UCSC Genome Browser**](https://genome.ucsc.edu) **(University of California, Santa Cruz Genome Browser)**:\
    The UCSC Browser is a widely used genomic resource that allows to display a requested portion of a genome at any scale, accompanied by a series of aligned annotation *tracks*, such as gene predictions, mRNA, SNPs, expression and regulatory data, phenotype and variation data and species comparative genomics data (all shown in one window). The database tables underlying the individual tracks can be viewed and downloaded, using the UCSC Table Browser. Researchers can upload their personal datasets as custom annotation tracks in both browsers.

-   [**NCBI:dbSNP**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/):\
    NCBI:dbSNP is a database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) that catalogs single nucleotide variations, microsatellites, and small-scale insertions and deletions in the human genome. Primarily, it's a deposition database; not all entries in the database are manually curated.

-   [**ClinVar**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)**(Clinical Variation)**:\
    ClinVar is a NCBI database that collects and curates information about genetic variants and their clinical significance. It aggregates data from various sources, including research studies, clinical laboratories, and expert panels. ClinVar is used as basis for curated variant-disease associations in ClinGen.

-   [**ClinGen**](https://clinicalgenome.org) **(Clinical Genome Resource)**:\
    ClinGen is an expert-curated genomic resource that aims to improve the understanding and interpretation of genomic variants in the context of clinical practice. It also offers tools and resources to aid in variant interpretation, including variant pathogenicity calculators, gene-disease validity as well as clinical actionability assessments. The overarching aim is to advance precision medicine and research by developing standards and guidelines for variant interpretation.

-   [**COSMIC**](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) **(Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer)**:\
    COSMIC is an expert-curated database that provides comprehensive information about genetic alterations observed in cancer genomes, with a focus on somatic point mutations and small insertions/deletion. It enables the identification of frequently mutated genes, the exploration of mutation patterns across different cancer types, and informs about the functional impact and the clinical relevance of these mutations.

-   [**CGI**](https://www.cancergenomeinterpreter.org/analysis) **(Cancer Genome Interpreter)**:\
    The primary use of the Cancer Genome Interpreter (CGI) is to assist in the interpretation of cancer genomic data. CGI allows researchers and clinicians to upload and analyze their own cancer genomic data. It identifies potentially oncogenic alterations and flags genomic biomarkers of drug response with different levels of clinical relevance.
