Whole exome sequencing (WES):
The Exon is the region on the Chromosom which encodes for the according Protein. 
All Exon together are called Exom. WES Method is useful for identifing coding region of genes which affect protein function.
But it does not show you Alteration in the Intron regions, which also influence the Genom dynamic.
Mutations are detected faster and allow to characterise a specific disease. It is a commonly used Method
in the Diagnostic and guides precise medicine.

In 2015 the cost for a whole exom sequencing was about 1000$ - 5000$. Declining trend
