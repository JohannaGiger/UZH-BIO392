# Question 1: What is CNV and CNA?

## Copy number aberrations (CNAs):
Dosage imbalance get detected in diffrent regions in the Genome. The somatic mutations often leads to cancer.
These Alteration are monitored to recognize the origin of the cancer.


## copy number variation (CNV):
Sequences of genome are repeated but the number of repeats are diffrent between the individuals.
It has a great application in the diagnostics in metabolism and susceptibility to infectious diseases and more.


# Question 2: How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)?

Progenetix is a data storage platform which is accessible for everyone. The Goal is to provide genomic variation profiles in cancer.
The storage is filled from several studies and with diffrent approaches to detect the source of cancer.
The most common approaches are: 
  - The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
  - cBioPortal
  - array-based data from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
  - European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)’s ArrayExpress 

Cancer types...

# Question 3: Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships.
## National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCIt)
NCIt tracks the development ontology. Mutation from diffrent sides can lead to the same cancer. With this approach you can monitor the steps and their origin
and diffrent classification.

## ICD-O: International Classification of Diseases for Oncology
Provides organ- and substructure specific mapping and diagnostic aspects of tumor entity

## Uberon: is a cross-species anatomical structural ontology system closely aligned with developmental processes 

## These are diffrent databases to characterise the cancer. 


# Question 4: What are CNV Segementations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them?
CNV are divided into two classes: 
 1. Seqmentation: Chromosomes-arm (p: short-arm, q: long-arm)
 2. Frequencies: Small aberration in the genome spread, which lead to Loss of Function(LOH).

It varies among the cancer type which kind of origin it occurs.

# Question 5: What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?
## API: Application programming interface
It is a tool that allow two or more programms to communicate with each other.

It depends on the programm which output of the genome wide studies are shown. The diffrent sources use diffrent parameters as following:
  - mapping of the region the mutation occurs (geohraphically)
  - tissue location
  - cancer type
  - chromosomal location
  - cell line
  - customized visualisation


# Question 6: How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?


# Question 7: What do you think should be improved in progenetix?
