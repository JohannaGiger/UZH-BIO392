Question 1: What is CNV and CNA?

# Copy number aberrations (CNAs):
Dosage imbalance get detected in diffrent regions in the Genome. The somatic mutations often leads to cancer.
These Alteration are monitored to recognize the origin of the cancer.


# copy number variation (CNV):
Sequences of genome are repeated but the number of repeats are diffrent between the individuals.
It has a great application in the diagnostics in metabolism and susceptibility to infectious diseases.


Question 2: How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)?

Progenetix is a data storage platform which is accessible for everyone. The Goal is to provide genomic variation profiles in cancer.
The storage is filled from several studies and with diffrent approaches to detect the source of cancer.
The most common approaches are: 
  - The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
  - cBioPortal
  - array-based data from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
  - European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)’s ArrayExpress 



Question 3: Describe NCIt, ICOD, UBERON codes, and their relationships.
# National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCIt)


# NCIt is a dynamically developed hierarchical ontology, which empowers layered data aggregation and transfer between classification systems and resources.

# While the ICD-O topography system provides organ- and substructure-specific mapping rooted in traditional clinical and diagnostic aspects of a ‘tumor entity’

# ‘UBERON’ is a cross-species anatomical structural ontology system closely aligned with developmental processes 

Question 4: What are CNV Segementations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them?

Question 5: What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?

Question 6: How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?

Question 7: What do you think should be improved in progenetix?
