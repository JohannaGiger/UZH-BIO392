Disease | Disease description | Gene | Variants (HGVS) |
----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------
Hemochromatosis | a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet | HJV | NM_213653.4:c.187C>T | 
Thalassemia | a misfunction of the red blood cells (Hemoglobin) which leads to a higher degradation and a lower amount of blood cells | ATRX | NM_000489.6:c.6253C>T
Haemophilia | Blood clotting disorder in whicht the  hemostoasis is restricted. Higher bloodflow when wounded | F9 | NM_000133.4:c.1113C>A
Cystic Fibrosis | a defect ionchannel (CFTR) leads to greater viscous mucus. Any gland can be affected mainly the lung is damaged | CTFR | NM_000492.4:c.3623del
Tay Sachs Disease | destruction of the nerv cells in the brain and spinal leads to hearloss, loss of ability to react and finally to premature death | HEXA | NM_000520.6:c.1385A>T
Fragile X Syndrom | a genetic disease on the X chromosom leads to Neurons growth disorder. Patients have intelligence reduction. A part on the X chromosom is mutated which is essential for neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity. | COL1A1 | NM_000088.4:c.934C>T
Huntington's Disease | Neurodegenerative Disease manifests itself through involuntary, uncoordinated movements increasing loss of muscle control from the age of 40 onwards | PRNP | NM_000311.5:c.593T>C

Gene | Gene name | Chromosomal location | Gene prodcut | Disease | Disease description
----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
CFTR | CF transmembrane conductance regulator | 7q31.2 | epithelial ion channel, transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane | cystic fibrosis | a genetic disorder chrachtericzed by the production of sweat with a igh salt content and mucus secretion with an abnormal viscosity | 
CYBB |cytochrome b-245, beta chain | Xp21.1-p11.4 | cytochrome b-245, beta chain | granulomatous disease, chronic, X-linked | immunodeficiency which manifests itself after the first year of life. White blodd cells are unable to fight against bacterial and fungal intruders.
HJV | hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor | 1q21.1 | hemojuvelin | hemochromatosis type 2A | Hemojuvelin is a protein that regulates the proper iron balance in the body. Misfunction leads to accumulation of iron. It is expressed in the heart, liver and muscles. 
CDKN2A | cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A | 9p21.3 | cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor | melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome | It is a control protein in the cell cycle. Misfunction leads to increased cell division \
leads to organ malformations in pancreas brain, esophagus, stomach, urinary bladder |
KRAS | KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase | 12p12.1 | K-Ras, that is part of a signaling pathway known as the RAS/MAPK pathway | noonan syndrome | Growth disorders, heart defect
TP53 | tumor protein p53 | 17p13.1 | p53  | Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1 | a tumor suppressor in many tumor types preventing tumor development. a germline mutation of the tumor suppressor gene p53
FMR1 | fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 | Xq27.3 | FMRP | Fragile X syndrom | a genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectueal disability |
