## Genomic Data risks & Opportunities

For the last 30 years the knowledge about the human genom and the associated opportunities have exponentially increased. 
The access to our sequence of nucleotides is unprecedented cheap and fast. The MinION device, a USB compatible DNA sequencer, 
has become available for the normal consumers. It enables you to sequence the DNA, without a labour at your own laptop at home.
The device record trough electrical currence differences the according nucleotide sequence. For this reason more data can be generated, plus more
people are willing to donate their DNA codes and participate in genom studies. The handling with the data not just brings us possibilities about our 
increasing health and take action at early stage, it also entails social risks. It presents the big question: Security or freedom? 

### --- Forensic convict perpetrator ---
With the powerful statistic in processing genomic Data, it is possible to built a face of a suspect just from a DNA. 
This technologie would support the forensic investigation enormously, however not every country allow this method
due to historical cases in which the DNA samples at the crime scene could not have been distinguished certainly. 
Also identical twins have to be considered, which share 100% of the same DNA of their siblings. But profiling:
Determining the sex, the eye colour, the skin complexion, geopraphic origin and other specific characterstic are nowadays
commonly used in switzerland to search for criminals. 
However, the so-called "forensic DNA phenotyping" is also causing some controversy.
Some scientists are skeptical of the technology's accuracy, particularly with regard to its capacity to reproduce facial images. Others claim that employing these methods increase the use of racial profiling by law enforcement and violation on privacy. 

### --- Health Insuracnce & Surveillance
One benefit of genomic surveillance could be that a device feedbacks you metabolism status. So that your smart watch advises you 
to take your medicine due to alternate hormone level. This surveillance could drive the human body to a permament peak performance.

Opportunities are also given in the health insurance industry. In the analyzed genom, are informations stored about the probability of getting certain diseases(e.x.: cancer, alzheimer, parkinsons etc.). The health condition could now be classified into several status and the monthly health insurance premium would align with it. Healther people or carrier of less tendency gens would therefore pay less than people with higher risk of having a disease. This injustice with the distribution of genes should be borne by the general public.
