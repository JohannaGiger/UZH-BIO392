## Genomic Data risks & Opportunities

For the last 30 years the knowledge about the human genom and the associated opportunities have exponentially increased. 
The access to our sequence of nucleotides is unprecedented cheap and fast. The MinION device, a USB compatible DNA sequencer, 
has become available for the normal consumers. It enables you to sequence the DNA, without a labour at your own laptop at home.
The device record trough electrical currence differences the according nucleotide sequence. For this reason more data can be generated, plus more
people are willing to donate their DNA codes and participate in genom studies. The handling with the data not just brings us possibilities about our 
increasing health and take action at early stage, it also entails social risks. 

### --- Forensic convict perpetrator ---
With the powerful statistic in processing genomic Data, it is possible to built a face of a suspect just from a DNA. 
This technologie would support the forensic investigation enormously, however not every country allow this method
due to historical cases in which the DNA samples at the crime scene could not have been distinguished certainly and the 
wrong suspect has been arrested. 
Also identical twins have to be considered, which share 100% of the same DNA of their siblings and therefore can not uniquely identified. But profiling:
Determining the sex, the eye colour, the skin complexion, geopraphic origin and other specific characterstic are nowadays
commonly used in switzerland to search for criminals. 
However, the so-called "forensic DNA phenotyping" is also causing some controversy.
Some scientists are skeptical of the technology's accuracy, particularly with regard to its capacity to reproduce facial images. Others claim that employing these methods increase the use of racial profiling by law enforcement and violation on privacy. 

### --- Health Insuracnce & Surveillance ---
One benefit of genomic surveillance could be that a device feedbacks you metabolism status. So that your smart watch advises you 
to take your medicine due to alternate hormone level. This surveillance could drive the human body to a permament peak performance.

Opportunities are also given in the health insurance industry. In the analyzed genom, are informations stored about the probability of getting certain diseases(e.x.: cancer, alzheimer, parkinsons etc.). The health condition could now be classified into several status and the monthly health insurance premium would align with it. Healther people or carrier of less risk tendency gens would therefore pay less than people with higher risk of getting a disease. This injustice with the distribution of genes should be borne by the general public.

### --- Humans playing God - Intervention ---
With the prenatal examination we can see malformations or possible disease in the unborn baby to intervent. To take it 
to the extreme, we are capable of playing god and interfere in the natural selection. Such that just healthy humans are born or people who show specific phenotypic characterstics. Is this ethically acceptable?

### --- Data Security ---
Where is light there is also shadow. The most critical point about the genomic Data is to assure the privacy and Datasecurity. With the information about the DNA we can encode our physics our phenotype, associated disease and all about us. Companies can therefore advertise to us specifically with the knowledge of what we will need or what is good for us. Great knowledge leads to great power and ultimately to great responsibility. 


Are we as humanity ready for the next revolution?
