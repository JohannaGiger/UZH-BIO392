### Genomic Data risks & Opportunities

For the last 30 years the knowledge about the human genom and the associated opportunities have exponentially increased. 
The access to our sequence of nucleotides is unprecedented cheap and fast. The MinION device, a USB compatible DNA sequencer, 
has become available for the normal consumers. It enables you to sequence the DNA, without a labour at your own laptop at home.
The device record trough electrical currence differences the according nucleotide sequence. For this reason more data can be generated, plus more
people are willing to donate their DNA codes and participate in genom studies. The handling with the data not just brings us possibilities about our 
increasing health and take action at early stage, it also entails social risks. It presents the big question: Security or freedom? 




The MinION device, a USB compatible handheld DNA sequencer, has become available in the
last few years. Its size, speed and portability could enable many new uses for DNA sequencing. currently DNA readings from the MinION are not accurate enough to be
used to reliably confirm the identity of human cells used in research. hus far, re-identification required an intersection of 91â€”195 SNPs from the MinION sketch and
reference SNP file to reach a match probability of 99.9%.
