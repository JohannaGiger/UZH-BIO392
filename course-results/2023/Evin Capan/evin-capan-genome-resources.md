##  NCBI Genome Resource
The National Center for Biotechnology Information ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/human/index.shtml)) Genome Resource is an extensive platform that provides access to a vast collection of genomic data: Sequences, annotations, and associated data for a wide range of organisms, including human and many other species. NCBIs genome assemblies are the result of collaboration efforts between researchers and sequencing centers. NCBI also has information on genetic variations and offers access to the GRh38 reference genome.
