# Genome Resources
##  NCBI Genome Resource
The National Center for Biotechnology Information ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/human/index.shtml)) Genome Resource is an extensive platform that provides access to a vast collection of genomic data: Sequences, annotations, and associated data for a wide range of organisms, including human and many other species. NCBIs genome assemblies are the result of collaboration efforts between researchers and sequencing centers. NCBI also has information on genetic variations and offers access to the GRh38 reference genome.

## Ensembl
[Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html) is a genomic browser specializing in vertebrate genomes, facilitating research in comparative genomics, evolutionary biology, sequence variations, and transcriptional regulation. It annotates genes, performs diverse alignments, predicts regulatory roles, and compiles disease-related information. Ensembl offers a suite of tools like BLAST, BLAT, BioMart, and the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) applicable to all supported species. There are also sister Ensemble sites, namely Ensembl Bacteria, Ensembl Fungi, Ensemble Plants, Ensembl Protists and Ensembl Metazoa.

## Genome Reference Consortium (GRC)
The [Genome Reference Consortium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc) plays a crucial role in curating, enhancing, and updating reference genomes, focussing on the human genome. The GRC wants to provide the best representation of the human genome to meet basic and clinical research needs and to represent the genetic diversity of the human pangenome. The GRC also evaluated new models and sequences of the Telomere-to-Telomere Consortium and the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium.

## UCSC Genome Browser
The University of California, Santa Cruz ([UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/)) Genome Browser is a widely used web-based tool that provides a visual interface for exploring and analyzing genomic data.

## Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI)
[MGI](https://www.informatics.jax.org/) serves as the global database for laboratory mice, providing integrated genetic, genomic, and biological data to support the investigation of human health and disease by providing a comprehensive resource for mouse-related research.
