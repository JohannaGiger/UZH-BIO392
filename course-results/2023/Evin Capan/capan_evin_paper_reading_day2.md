**Question 1:** What is CNV/CNA?

CNA stands for copy number aberration. CNAs represent a type of nearly ubiquitous and frequently extensive structural genome variations. These variations are present in most types of cancer and exert functional impact in cancer development. Because of this, the comparative and meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections can be of great importance to disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis and to identify and characterise molecular subtypes.

Although CNV (copy number variation) and CNA are often used interchangeably, there is a small difference, namely, the time of occurrence of these events: CNA refers to genomic aberrations due to somatic events (usually found in tumors) and CNV refers to variations due to germline events.
