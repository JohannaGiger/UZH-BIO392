**Question 1:** What is CNV/CNA?

CNA stands for copy number aberration. CNAs represent a type of nearly ubiquitous and frequently extensive structural genome variations. These variations are present in most types of cancer and exert functional impact in cancer development. Because of this, the comparative and meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections can be of great importance to disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis and to identify and characterise molecular subtypes.

Although CNV (copy number variation) and CNA are often used interchangeably, there is a small difference, namely, the time of occurrence of these events: CNA refers to genomic aberrations due to somatic events (usually found in tumors) and CNV refers to variations due to germline events.

**Question 2:** How will you describe or introduce progenetic  (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)?

Progenetix (progenetix.org) is a publicly accessible cancer genome data resource. It aims to provide a comprehensive representation of genomic variation profiles in cancer, through providing sample-specific CNA profiles and associated metadata as well as services related to data annotation, meta-analysis and visualization. After its establishment in 2001 with a focus on data from chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridisation (CGH) studies, the resource began progressively incorporating data from hundreds of publications reporting on genome profiling experiments based on molecular cytogenetics (genomic arrays, CGH) and sequencing (whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing — WGS or WES). During the last few years,  there have been significant advancements in the fields of genomics and cancer research in terms of molecular genetics technology, disease concepts, data standard harmonisation as well as data availability, in an increasingly structured and systematic manner, which lead to continuous data integration, curation and maintenance for the Progenetix resource, resulting in the most comprehensive representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 (including 115 357 tumor) copy number variation (CNV) profiles. These advancements generated a 4.5-fold increase in sample number since 2013, improvements in data quality, ontology representation and new and better data access.
Since 2014, large quantities of data content has been added: from the previously separate arrayMap data collectio, from external resources and projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or cBioPortal, as well as NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which contribute a substantial fraction of the genomic screening data, or EMBL-EBI’s ArrayExpress.
