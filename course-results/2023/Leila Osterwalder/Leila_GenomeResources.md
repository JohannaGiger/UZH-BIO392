# Task: Exploring Genome Resources

## Human Genome Resources at NCIB
- Reference Genome: Possibility to download the reference human genome assembly in various formats (for example FASTA). 
- Genetic Variation: access data related to genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and structural variations in the human genome
- Sequencing Data: links to sequence data archives 
- Tools and Software: tools and software resources for analyzing and working with human genome data (e.g. ClinVar aggregates information about genomic variation and its relationship to human health)

##  UCSC Genome Browser
- Species Tree and connected assembly hubs: sequences of different species are available
- genome visualisation of  genomic data, such as DNA sequences, gene annotations, and other genomic features (zoom in option)
Different tools to use:
- **BLAT** (BLAST-Like Alignment Tool): very fast sequence alignment tool similar to BLAST  (http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start)
- **In-Silico PCR**: searches a sequence database with a pair of PCR primers, using an indexing strategy for fast performance

## ClinGen
National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded resource dedicated to building a central resource that defines the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine and research. Search query for a specific gene (e.g. MYC) and its association with a disease. Provides curated knowledge to ClinVar.

## ClinVar
A database of genomic variants and the interpretation of their relevance to disease.
ClinVar is a NCBI resource of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes.
