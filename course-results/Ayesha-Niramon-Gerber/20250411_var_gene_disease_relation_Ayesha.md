|CFTR|CF transmembrane conductance regulator|7q31.2|epithelial ion channel, transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane|Cystic fibrosis|a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity|
|CYBB|cytochrome b-245 beta chain|Xp21.1-p11.4|1. terminal component of a respiratory chain that transfers single electrons from cytoplasmic NADPH across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen on the exterior. 2. voltage-gated proton channel that mediates the H(+) currents of resting phagocyte 3. participates in the regulation of cellular pH|granulomatous disease|primary immunodeficiency disorder of phagocytes resulting from impaired killing of bacteria and fungi.|
|HJV|hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor|1q21.1|Bone morphogenetic protein coreceptor, regulates hepcidin expression and iron homeostasis|hemochromatosis type 2A|Built up of iron in the body, which accumulates and leads to organ damage.|
|CDKN2A|cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A|9p21.3|Negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by interacting strongly with CDK4 and CDK6, which inhibits their ability to interact with cyclins D and to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein.|melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome|increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer|
