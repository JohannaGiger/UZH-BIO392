## Answers to Progenetix Text

# 1. What is CNV/CNA?
CNV(Copy number Variation) oder CNA (Copy Number Aberration) are changes in the genomic structure. Parts of the DNA have different numbers in copy by being duplicated or deleted. They play an important part in cancer development, because most cancer types have CNV/CNA in genes, which influeces the cell cycle.

# 2. How will you describe or introduce progenetix (scale, data source, cancer types and so on)?
Progenetix is the largest open cancer genome data bank in the world. 
There are over 138'000 CNV profiles (over 115'000 are from tumors) from over 1900 studies.
Data sources are: GEO, ArrayExpress, TCgA, cBioPortal.
Progenetix includes over 788 NClt cancer types.

# 3. Describe NClt, ICD-O, UBERON codes, and their relationships.
NCIT, ICD-O and UBERON codes are different code systems for classification. 
- NCIT (National Cancer Institute Thesaurus) has a hierarchical ontology structure, which allows more flexible grouping.
- ICD-O (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology) codes for topography and morphology of tumors. 
- UBERON describes ontology of organ and tissues structure systenmatically. 
Progenetix connects those three classification codes to makes it easier to find the relevant data. 

# 4. What are CNV segmentations and CNV frequencies, and how to use them?
- CNV segmentation splits the genome into segments with the same amount of gen copies. This makes it easier to find genome variation (duplication & deletion).
- CNV frequencies tell how often a specific CNV segment appears in a group. 
In progenetix CNV segmentation & frequencise are used to detect and analyse common patterns in different cancer types. 

# 5. What are APIs and how to use APIs in progenetix?
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allows programs to directly use data from data banks. In progenetix Beacon API is used to find specific CNAs in the large data bank. 

# 6. How does progenetix visualise CNA profiles?
Progenetix visualise CNA profiles to genome plots, Heatmaps, Distribution graphs and boxplots. Data can be sorted and additional data can be uploaded.

# 7. What do you think should be imporved in progenetix?
The progenetix website could be more user friendly by making it more intuitive. Easier tools or more tutorials how to use the application.
