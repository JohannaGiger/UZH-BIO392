# **Asssignment by Basil Burri**


### Task of this assignment
- Query disease names on [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) to assess disease associated variants.
- Query gene names on [ClinGen](https://clinicalgenome.org/) to assess which disease they cause when varied.


## **Relational list using [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)**

**Settings for ClinVar query**
- Classification type: Germline
- Germline classification: Pathogenic
- Review status: Multiple submitters

**Variation selection**
- The disease name was queried and then a variation was selected that is associated with the disease.
- Only variations were selected on ClinVar which have a "Pathogenic" association with the diesease, "Pathogenic/Likely pathogenic" variations were ignored.

**Disease descriptions**
- Derived from [National Health Service](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/), [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/), and [Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man](https://www.omim.org/).

## **Relational list using [ClinGen](https://clinicalgenome.org/)**

**Gene selection**
- The gene name was queried and then a gene was selectet which matches unambiguously the query.
- Only genes were selected on ClinGen that are "protein-coding genes", "pseudogenes" were ignored.
- The disease was assessed by looking at the "Dosage Sensitivity" informations for each gene.

**Gene descriptions**
- Derived from the "Gene Facts" for each queried gene on ClinGen.
