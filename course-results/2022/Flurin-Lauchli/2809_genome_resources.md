# Task: Exploring Genome Resources
- primary deposition databases
- interpreted databases (e.g. variant annotations...)
- suggestion: VICC paper (Wagner et al.)
  Wagner et al (2020): A harmonized meta-knowledgebase of clinical interpretations of somatic genomic variants in cancer
make some notes about different genome resources and their primary use
*Don't think only "human"*

|---------|-------|
| [MycoCosm](https://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/mycocosm/home) | integrates fungal genomics data and analytical tools for fungal biologists. It provides navigation through sequenced genomes, genome analysis in context of comparative genomics and genome-centric view. |
| [PhycoCosm](https://jgi.doe.gov/our-science/science-programs/fungal-genomics/phycocosm-algal-portal/) | data access, visualization, and analysis tools for comparative genomics of algae. PhycoCosm enables users to navigate across sequenced algae genomes, and to conduct comparative and genome-centric analyses of algae and community annotation. |
