# Task: Exploring Genome Resources
- primary deposition databases
- interpreted databases (e.g. variant annotations...)
- suggestion: VICC paper (Wagner et al.)
  Wagner et al (2020): A harmonized meta-knowledgebase of clinical interpretations of somatic genomic variants in cancer
make some notes about different genome resources and their primary use
*Don't think only "human"*

|Resource | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| [MycoCosm](https://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/mycocosm/home) | integrates fungal genomics data and analytical tools for fungal biologists. It provides navigation through sequenced genomes, genome analysis in context of comparative genomics and genome-centric view. |
| [PhycoCosm](https://jgi.doe.gov/our-science/science-programs/fungal-genomics/phycocosm-algal-portal/) | data access, visualization, and analysis tools for comparative genomics of algae. PhycoCosm enables users to navigate across sequenced algae genomes, and to conduct comparative and genome-centric analyses of algae and community annotation. |
| [UCSC](http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/) | The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser is a Web-based tool for quickly displaying a requested portion of a genome at any scale, accompanied by a series of aligned annotation “tracks.” The annotations generated by the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group and external collaborators include gene predictions, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, simple nucleotide polymorphisms, expression and regulatory data, phenotype and variation data, and pairwise and multiple-species comparative genomics data. |
| [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) | The NCBI houses a series of databases relevant to biotechnology and biomedicine and is an important resource for bioinformatics tools and services. Major databases include GenBank for DNA sequences and PubMed, a bibliographic database for biomedical literature. Other databases include the NCBI Epigenomics database. All these databases are available online through the Entrez search engine. |
| [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) | Ensembl is a genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation. Ensembl annotates genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data. Ensembl tools include BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for all supported species. |
| [ClinGen](https://clinicalgenome.org/) | ClinGen is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded resource dedicated to building a central resource that defines the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine and research. |
