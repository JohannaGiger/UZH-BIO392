|----|---------|--------------------|------------|-------|-------------------|
|CFTR|CF transmembrane conductance regulator|7q31.2|epithelial ion channel, transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane|Cystic fibrosis|a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity|		 |
|CYBB|cytochrome b-245 beta chain|	Xp21.1-p11.4	| 	Critical component of the membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes that generates superoxide	|granulomatous disease|	genetic disorder in which white blood cells called phagocytes are unable to kill certain types of bacteria and fung	 |
|HJV|	hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor	 |	1q21.1	|	bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor |	hemochromatosis type 2A	|	 disease in which too much iron builds up in the body	 |
|CDKN2A|	cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A	|	9p21.3	|	negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by interacting strongly with CDK4 and CDK6	|	melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome	|	mutation carriers have an increased risk of developing malignant melanoma and/or pancreatic cancer	 |
|KRAS|	KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase	    |	12p12.1	|	Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (PubMed:20949621). Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:23698361, PubMed:22711838). Plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in a ZNF304-dependent manner	|	Noonan syndrome	|	genetic disorder that prevents normal development in various parts of the body	 |
|TP53|	 tumor protein p53   	|	17p13.1	|	Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type. Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression	|	Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1	|	rare hereditary or genetic disorder that increases the risk you and your family members will develop cancer	 |
|	FMR1	|	fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1	|	Xq27.3	|	Multifunctional polyribosome-associated RNA-binding protein that plays a central role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity through the regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA dendritic transport and postsynaptic local protein synthesis of a subset of mRNAs (PubMed:16631377, PubMed:18653529, PubMed:19166269, PubMed:23235829, PubMed:25464849). Plays a role in the alternative splicing of its own mRNA (PubMed:18653529). Plays a role in mRNA nuclear export	|Fragile X syndrome|a genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability|
