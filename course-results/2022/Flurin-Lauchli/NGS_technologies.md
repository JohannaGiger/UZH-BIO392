## NGS technologies

next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies = large-scale DNA sequencing technology that allows for querying the entire genome (whole genome), the exons within all known genes (whole exome), or only exons of selected genes (target panel). 
in contrast to sanger sequencing, NGS does not rely on primers.

## molecular cytogenetig techniques
### bandinng analysis
- allows each chromosome to be identified by its characteristic banding pattern
- in general, the dark bands have a lower G-C content than the interbands, where genes tend to be located

### SNP arrays
- single nucleotide polymorphisms are single base mutations that are estabilhed in the genepoll of a population 
- SNP arrays check for SNPs at specific loci
- these arrays are widely used in diagnostics and in forensics, as they provide relatively quick and cheap, yet accurate information

### array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
- molecular cytogenetic technique that enables the genome-wide analysis of DNA copy numbers
- Array CGH involves cohybridizing a test (patient) DNA sample and a control (reference) DNA sample, each differentially labeled with different colored fluorescent dyes (usually red and green, respectively), to a microarray slide containing thousands of DNA probes (oligos) that cover the entire human genome.

## spectral karyotyping (SKY)
- hybridization-based technique originally developed to diagnose chromosomal aberrations associated with cancer, and genetic disease. SKY can be used to detect specific inter, and intra-chromosomal genomic rearrangements, and unambiguously determine both the total number, and individual identity of all chromosomes in a metaphase nucleus
- each chromosome painted in a different color
- based on the hybridization of collections of chromosome-specific FISH probes labeled with different fluorochromes or fluorochrome combinations

## multiplex in situ hybridization (M-FISH)
- 24-color karyotyping technique
- labeling of all chromosomes in the genome with finite numbers of spectrally distinct fluorophores in a combinatorial fashion, such that each homologous pair of chromosomes is uniquely labeled


### M-FISH vs. SKY
In MFISH, a highly sensitive monochrome camera captures a series of images that have passed through different filters. Specific computer software analyzes the acquired data from the probes and pseudocolors of the chromosomes for analysis. The SKY is based on the principles of spectral imaging and Fourier spectroscopy. Five pure dyes that are spectrally distinct are used in combination to create the unique chromosome cocktail of the probe.

## chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)
- molecular cytogenetic method for analysing copy number variations (CNVs) relative to ploidy level in the DNA of a test sample compared to a reference sample, without the need for culturing cells
- increased/decreased numbers of copies of a piece of DNA are detected through flourescence intensity ration ≠ 1 of the test sample color vs. the reference sample color
