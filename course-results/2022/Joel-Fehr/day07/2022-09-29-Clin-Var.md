|Gene|Gene name|Chromosomal location|Gene product|Disease|Disease description|
|----|---------|--------------------|------------|-------|-------------------|
|CFTR|CF transmembrane conductance regulator|7q31.2|epithelial ion channel, transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane|Cystic fibrosis|a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity|		 |
|CYBB|Cytochrome B-245 Beta Chain		    |Xp21.1-p11.4		| Critical component of the membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes that generates superoxide. It is the terminal component of a respiratory chain that transfers single electrons from cytoplasmic NADPH across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen on the exterior.		|	granulomatous disease	|	genetic disorder impaired white blood cells are unable to kill certain types of bacteria	 |
|HJV|	Hemojuvelin    |1q21.1		|	Acts as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor. Through enhancement of BMP signaling regulates hepcidin (HAMP) expression and regulates iron homeostasis	|	Hemochromatosis	|	over-absorption of iron, can result in iron storage in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart	 |
|CDKN2A|cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A		|	9p21.3	|	Acts as a negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by interacting strongly with CDK4 and CDK6.	|	melanoma, glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer	|	abnormal cell growth	 |
|KRAS|	KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase	    |12p12.1		| Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity. Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation		|	Colorectal cancer, Lung cancer	|	abnormal cell growth	 |
|TP53|tumor protein p53	    	|	17p13.1	|	Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type.	|	Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1	|	higher predisposition for cancer	 |
|	FMR1	|	Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1	|	Xq27.3	|	Multifunctional polyribosome-associated RNA-binding protein that plays a central role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity through the regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA dendritic transport and postsynaptic local protein synthesis of a subset of mRNAs.	|Fragile X syndrome|a genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability|
