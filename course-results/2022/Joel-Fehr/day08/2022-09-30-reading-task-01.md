# A genomic view of short tandem repeats

### Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease?

- plays important role in some diseases including Fragile X Syndrome and Spinal muscular atrophy. 
- affect RNA splicing
- contribute to de-novo mutations per generation

---

### What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data?

- STRs do often not conver entire repeats, reduces number of informative reads.
