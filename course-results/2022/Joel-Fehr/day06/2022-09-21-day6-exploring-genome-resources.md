# Task: Exploring Genome Resources

| Genome Resource | Notes |
|-----------------|------------|
[UCSC](http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/) | This data-base is open-source. It contains reference genomes of many species. The GUI can be used for browsing different genomes and it also has a FASTA format sequence alignment tool called BLAT. This is useful for simply finding sequences. It also has a liftOver tool. |
[NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) | This data-base contains human reference genomes which are part of the Human Genome Project. The data-base contains informations about many aspects like duplications, insertions, deletions but also SNP's. Additionally to these genomic variations the data-base also links these to human health. |
[ClinGen](https://clinicalgenome.org/) | The data-base of ClinGen contains information about genes and their clinical relevance. This database contains data of the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine and research. One goal of them is: <blockquote>"Produce a public resource of clinically relevant genes and variants through the ongoing evolution of data standards, evidence frameworks and biocuration tools that support a worldwide expert curation ecosystem involving diverse participants.[^1]"<blockquote/> |
[Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html) | This data-base contains informations about reference genomes for many species. It also contains information about sequence variations. | The data-base has an `Perl API` in use for direct access. |
