# Genome technologies

## Overview NGS technologies
Since the days of Sanger sequencing, next-generation sequencing technologies have significantly evolved to provide increased data output, efficiencies, and applications. These next generations of technologies can be categorized based on read length.
* Short-read vs. long-read sequencing
  - Short reads are cheaper, can sequence fragmented DNA and show higher sequence fidelity than long reads.
  - With long reads one can sequence also difficult regions such as repeat sequences. It is also very useful for de novo assemblies.

## Count based vs. intensity based
* Read count based genotyping
  - Useful to genotype e.g. Transposable Elements because the principle includes sequencing amplicons after PCR and matching the reads to their targeted locations. The matched reads can be counted and higher read numbers can show the presence of a TE or with no reads also the abscence of a TE.
