## A genomic view of short tandem repeats
# Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease?
- Shows autosomal pattern and have impact on de novo mutations and impact in diseases
- have yet been missing in clinical surroundings because they are not detecable by the standard analyising methods

# What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data?
- often shot reads do not span the entire repeat sequence
- they are difficult to align
- with PCR: stutter effects

## TRAL: tandem repeat annotation library
# Why should you use multiple tandem repeat detection algorithms to look for repeats in biological sequence?
- 
# What different functionalities does TRAL provide?
