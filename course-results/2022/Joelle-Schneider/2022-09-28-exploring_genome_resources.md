# Genome Resources

## [UCSC Genome Browser](http://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html)
This is a platform from the Univerity of California in Santa Cruz. It originated from the Human Genome Project. One can look up a gene, a position of interest and see where it is located in the genome resp. which gene it is and also in what other kind of species it exists. On default also the gene expession and the sites with the most commen SNP's are shown.

## [Human Genome Resources at NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/human/)
Here you find a lot of different databases for example for DNA sequenes, epigenomics databases and human variant collections. Some of theme are mentioned below. Also it is possible to conduct a BLAST search for a sequence alignement.
* #### NCBI:dbSNP
This is a database for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and multiple small-scale variations including insertions/deletions, micorsatelites and non-polymophic variants. One can search for positions, gene names etc. It will then show different samples and also what the frequencies are in different populations for this kind of variation.
* #### NCBI:dbVAR
This is a database for genomic structural variation (VAR) like -insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, multinucleotide substitutions, mobile element insertions, translocations, complex chromosomal rearrangements. When searching for a gene it shows different variation, its location and what kind of variation it is. 
* #### NCBI:ClinVar
It is a database which contains information about variation and its relationship to human health. By looking up a gene or a region, different variants are given as an output. For each variant it contains the typ of variation, if it is pathogenic and its location.

## [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)
It is again a platform for gemone browsing. By entering either a gene, position or a protein one can get a lot of information like sequence splice variants, gene expression, regulation and a lot more. And again this platform offers different other tools like BLAST. 

## [EMBL-EBI:EVA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/)
A platform for all different genetic variation data from all kind of species.

## [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic)
It is a database for somatic mutation in cancer. One can select different tissues for example and then the all genes are displayed and one can select the one with possible mutation which have an impact on the developement of cancer.
