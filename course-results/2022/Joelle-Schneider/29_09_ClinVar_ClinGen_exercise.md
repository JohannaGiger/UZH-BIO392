|Disease|Disease description|Gene|Variants|
|-------|-------------------|----|--------|
|Hemochromatosis|a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet|HJV|NM_213653.3:c.959G>T|
|Thalassemia|inherited blood disorder with decreased synthesis of one of the polypeptide chains that form hemoglobin -> anemia|HBB|NM_000518.5(HBB):c.*113A>G, and many more|
|Haemophilia|is characterized by deficiency in factor VIII clotting activity that results in prolonged oozing after injuries, tooth extractions, or surgery, and delayed or recurrent bleeding prior to complete wound healing|FGG, F11, VWF|NM_021870.2(FGG):c.902G>A (p.Arg301His)|
|Cystic Fibrosis|multisystem disease affecting epithelia of the respiratory tract, exocrine pancreas, intestine, hepatobiliary system, and exocrine sweat glands. Morbidities include progressive obstructive lung disease with bronchiectasis, frequent hospitalizations for pulmonary disease, pancreatic insufficiency and malnutrition, recurrent sinusitis and bronchitis, and male infertility		|	NPHP4	|	NM_015102.5(NPHP4):c.3644+1G>T	|
|Tay sachs disease|HEXA disorders are best considered as a disease continuum based on the amount of residual beta-hexosaminidase A (HEX A) enzyme activity. This, in turn, depends on the molecular characteristics and biological impact of the HEXA pathogenic variants. HEX A is necessary for degradation of GM2 ganglioside; without well-functioning enzymes, GM2 ganglioside builds up in the lysosomes of brain and nerve cells		|HEXA|	NM_000520.6(HEXA):c.1549dup (p.Leu517fs)	|
|Fragile X syndrome|	FMR1 disorders include fragile X syndrome (FXS), fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and fragile X-associated primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI). Fragile X syndrome occurs in individuals with an FMR1 full mutation or other loss-of-function variant and is nearly always characterized in affected males by developmental delay and intellectual disability along with a variety of behavioral issues	|	FMR1	|	NM_002024.6(FMR1):c.1184G>A (p.Trp395Ter)	|
|Huntington's disease| progressive disorder of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric disturbances. The mean age of onset is 35 to 44 years, and the median survival time is 15 to 18 years after onset		|	PRNP	|NM_000371.4(TTR):c.148G>A (p.Val50Met)		|
