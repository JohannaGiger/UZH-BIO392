|Hemochromatosis|a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet|HJV|NM_213653.3:c.959G>T|
|Thalassemia|	An inherited blood disorder characterized by a decreased synthesis of one of the polypeptide chains that form hemoglobin. Anemia results from this abnormal hemoglobin formation.	|	HBB	|	NM_000518.5:c.*113A>G	|
