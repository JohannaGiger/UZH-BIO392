|Disease|Disease description|Gene|Variants|
|-------|-------------------|----|--------|
|Hemochromatosis|a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet|HJV|NM_213653.3:c.959G>T|
|Thalassemia|	An inherited blood disorder characterized by a decreased synthesis of one of the polypeptide chains that form hemoglobin. Anemia results from this abnormal hemoglobin formation.	|	HBB	|	NM_000518.5:c.*113A>G	|
|Haemophilia|	a mostly inherited genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, a process needed to stop bleeding	|	FGG	|	NM_021870.3:c.902G>A	|
|Cystic Fibrosis|	a multisystem disease affecting epithelia of the respiratory tract, exocrine pancreas, intestine, hepatobiliary system, and exocrine sweat glands	|	CFTR	|NM_000492.4:c.2T>C|
|Tay sachs disease|	neurodegenerative disorder in which infants, who are generally normal at birth, have progressive weakness and slowing of developmental progress between ages four and 12 months	|	HEXA	|	NM_000520.6:c.1549dup	|
|Fragile X syndrome|	a genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability	|	FMR1	|		|
|Huntington's disease|	progressive disorder of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric disturbances	|	HTT	|	NM_002111.8:c.52CAG[(36_39)]	|
