## 2nd generation:
amplification of seqence
sequencing in cycles, synchronisation required
high number of reads, short sequences, low input

## 3rd generation:
no amplification
sequencing on single molecules, no synchronisation required
low number of reads, long sequences, high input

## exapmles:
### Illumina:
2nd generation
1. Library preparation starting from any nucleic acid sample
2. Amplification on a solid surface
3. sequencing using parallel synthesis - sequencing by synthesis
4. alignment and data analysis
have short reads but high throughput (milions in parallel)
optics used for detection


### Ion Torrent:
2nd generation
Short reads, low throughput, less time needed
Clonal amplification by PCR - sequencing by synthesis
No optical detection â€“ sequencing is quick
ion current is measured


### PacBio:
3rd generation
Single Molecule Real Time Sequencing
watch the DNA Polymerase as it is replicating DNA 
attached Fluorescent dye at the phosphate, the fluophore is clipped off by the polymerase which can be detected
optical detection


### Oxford Nanopore:
3rd generation
very long reads, high error rates, expensive, less time needed, can be small machines
DNA strand to be sequenced is transportet through a pore (nanometers in size )
ion current is changed according to the Bases passing through it
this current is measured
