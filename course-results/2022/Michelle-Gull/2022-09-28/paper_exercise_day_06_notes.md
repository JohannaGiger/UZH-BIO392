## A copy number variation map of the human genome

### 1. Why is important to construct a CNV map on healthy individuals of various ethnicities? 
> The aim for clinical geneticists is to be able to discriminate pathogenic variants from benign variants in patients, but additional data of healthy individuals of various ethnicities are required due to the growing number of variants of unknown significance that are suspected to be involved in disease susceptibility. 

<br>

### 2. What is the CNV size that the authors defined? 
 Noted: The CNV size definition is still under debate and may be different in other literature.
> The authers defined the size to include microscopic and submicroscopic variants from 50 bp to 3 Mb. 

<br>

### 3. What are the primary approaches used for CNV detection? And what are the advantages and limitations of these technologies? (CNV discoveries)
The authors used clustering method to combine data from different studies into merged CNVRs (Copy number variable regions). 
> The primary approaches used for CNV detection are Microarrays and next-generation sequencing (NGS).
> The first studies to assay CNVs primarily used microarrays with bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and oligonucleotide arrays. Subsequent microarrays have included both comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and SNP-based arrays. During the past few years use of NGS technologies has been particularly widespread.
> array-based methods advantages: suitable for studying quantitative variants, identifying deletions and duplications however methods vary in their ability to detect deletions or duplications (more duplications are missed by SNP-based array platforms than by array CGH). 
> array-based methods limitations: limited resolution capacity, inflated estimates of toatal CNV content due to low resolution and overestimatin of breakpoints, detection of small variants
> NGS advantages: detection of small variants, detection of deletions, high sensitivity and the ability to provide accurate sequence-level breakpoint resolution
> NGS limitations: detection of duplications

### 4. What are the two criteria for cluster filtering? And why did they do this filtering? (The CNV map)
>

### 5. What are thresholds in stringency level 1, inclusive map (stringency level 2), and stringent map (stringency level 12) respectively? (The CNV map)
>

### 6. Which percentage of the genome contributes to CNV in inclusive map and stringent map respectively? (Properties of the CNV map)
>

### 7. By your intuition, which kind of genes are more variable between protein-coding genes and non-coding genes? How about their findings in this paper? (Functional impact of CNV)
>

### 8. The authors generated a null CNV map and found genes for which at least 85% of the exons were homozygous deleted. What are the functions of these genes? And why did the authors say that they seem to be non-essential? (Homozygous deleted genes)
>

### 9. If you are a medical doctor, how do you use this map as a tool to assess the clinical importance of a CNV? (Clinical application of the CNV map part in Discussion)
