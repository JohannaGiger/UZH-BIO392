### Analyse these genes:
* ERBB2+ (Location: 17q12)
    * This gene encodes a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases. This protein has no ligand binding domain of its own and therefore cannot bind growth factors. However, it does bind tightly to other ligand-bound EGF receptor family members to form a heterodimer, stabilizing ligand binding and enhancing kinase-mediated activation of downstream signalling pathways, such as those involving mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. Allelic variations at amino acid positions 654 and 655 of isoform a (positions 624 and 625 of isoform b) have been reported, with the most common allele, Ile654/Ile655. Amplification and/or overexpression of this gene has been reported in numerous cancers, including breast and ovarian tumors. Alternative splicing results in several additional transcript variants, some encoding different isoforms and others that have not been fully characterized.[^2]

* TP53- (Location: 17p13.1)
    * This gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein containing transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains. The encoded protein responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with a variety of human cancers, including hereditary cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Alternative splicing of this gene and the use of alternate promoters result in multiple transcript variants and isoforms. Additional isoforms have also been shown to result from the use of alternate translation initiation codons from identical transcript variants.[^3]
        * TP53 mutations were most frequent in gemistocytic astrocytomas, followed by fibrillary astrocytomas and oligoastrocytomas, whereas they were infrequent in oligodendrogliomas. TP53 mutations in low-grade diffuse gliomas frequently occurred in two hot-spot codons 248 and 273 (47% of all mutations). Of all the TP53 mutations identified in low-grade diffuse gliomas, 30 of 47 (64%) were G:C→A:T transitions, and of these, 90% were located at CpG sites. The high frequency of G:C→A:T transitions at CpG sites suggests a common mechanism of acquisition of these mutations in low-grade diffuse gliomas. The best-characterized mechanism of G:C→A:T transitions at CpG sites is deamination of 5-methylcytosine which is clustered at CpG sites, resulting in substitution of 5-methylcytosine by thymine. This occurs spontaneously or is mediated through the action of oxygen radicals or of nitric oxide produced by nitric oxide synthase in conditions of chronic inflammation. Previous finding of a significant correlation between TP53 mutations and promoter methylation of the O 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene in low-grade diffuse astrocytomas suggests the possible involvement of DNA alkylation at the O 6-position of guanine.[^7]

* MYC+ (Location: 8q24.21) 
    * This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients. There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini.[^4]
        * Interestingly, 8q gain is one of the most frequentc cytogenetic abnormalities of diffuse astrocytoma[^6]

* CDKN2A- (Location: 9p21.3)
     * This gene generates several transcript variants which differ in their first exons. At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported, two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4 kinase. The remaining transcript includes an alternate first exon located 20 Kb upstream of the remainder of the gene; this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame (ARF) that specifies a protein which is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants. This ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53 as it can interact with, and sequester, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2, a protein responsible for the degradation of p53. In spite of the structural and functional differences, the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene, through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression, share a common functionality in cell cycle G1 control. This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors, and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene.[^5]
