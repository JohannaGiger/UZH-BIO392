# Task 1
## STR background reading
- Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease?
> shows autosomal pattern and have impact on *de novo* mutations and impact in diseases <br>
have yet been missing in clinical surroundings because they are not detecable by the standard analyising methods
- What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data?
> often shot reads do not span the entire repeat sequence
they are difficult to align <br>
with PCR: stutter effects <br>

# Task 2
## Introduction to TRAL
- Why should you use multiple tandem repeat detection algorithms to look for repeats in biological sequence?
> To know the location of STRs in the reference genome for further genotyping STRs e.g., in GangSTR.
- What different functionalities does TRAL provide?
> Annotate with sequence profile models <br>
Annotate with *de novo* tandem repeat detectors <br>
Identify and filter overlapping annotations <br>
Test and filter for statistical significance <br>
Retrieve tandem repeat characteristics <br>
Performance evaluation
