|Gene|Gene name|Chromosomal location|Gene product|Disease|Disease description|
|----|---------|--------------------|------------|-------|-------------------|
|CFTR|CF transmembrane conductance regulator|7q31.2|epithelial ion channel, transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane|Cystic fibrosis|a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity|		 |
|CYBB|cytochrome b-245 beta chain|Xp21.1-p11.4|component of the membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes, transfers electrons from NADPH across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen|granulomatous disease|phagocytes are unable to kill certain types of bacteria and fungi, patients are highly susceptible to frequent and sometimes life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections|
|HJV|hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor|1q21.1|bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor, regulates hepcidin (HAMP) expression and  iron homeostasis |hemochromatosis type 2A|too much iron builds up in the body, which leads to an iron overload and organ damage|
