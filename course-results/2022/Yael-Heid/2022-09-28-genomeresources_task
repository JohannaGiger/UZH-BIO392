#exploring genome resources


NCBI:
dbSNP
- single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and multiple small-scale variations
- including insertions/deletions, microsatellites, non-polymorphic variants

dbVAR
- genomic structural variation 
- insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, multinucleotide substitutions, mobile element insertions, translocations, complex chromosomal rearrangements

ClinVar
- aggregates information about genomic variation and its relationship to human health
-  freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes
-  facilitates access to and communication about the relationships asserted between human variation and observed health status, and the history of that interpretation
-  processes submissions reporting variants found in patient samples, assertions made regarding their clinical significance, information about the submitter, and other supporting data


EMBL-EBI:
EVA
- open-access database of all types of genetic variation data from all species

Ensembl
- genome browser for vertebrate genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation
- annotate genes, computes multiple alignments, predicts regulatory function and collects disease data.
- Ensembl tools include BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) for all supported species



ClinGen: clinical Genome Resource
- ClinGen is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded resource dedicated to building a central resource that defines the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine and research
- founded in 2013 by the National Human Genome Research Institute
- is a growing collaborative effort, involving three grants, seven principal investigators and over 1,800 contributors from more than 45 countries
- to improve patient care through genomic Medicine


Progenetix: open resource oncogenomic database
- provides an overview of mutation data in cancer, with a focus on copy number abnormalities (CNV / CNA), for all types of human malignancies
- The data is based on individual sample data from currently 142063 samples


Cancer Genome Interpreter (CGI):
- Identifies potentially oncogenic alterations. (With BoostDM, a machine learning approach inspired in evolutionary biology and OncodriveMUT)
- Flags genomic biomarkers of drug response with different levels of clinical relevance.


The Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD):
- an attempt to collate all known (published) gene lesions responsible for human inherited disease
- at the institute ofe Medical Genetics in Cardiff


Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC):
-  is the world's largest and most comprehensive resource for exploring the impact of somatic mutations in human cancer.
-  manually curated from experts
-  they outline that data in terms of structure, content and scope making it easier to evaluate what to find in COSMIC, and how best to access it to fulfill the research needs
-  comprises the COSMIC database and the Cell Lines Project
