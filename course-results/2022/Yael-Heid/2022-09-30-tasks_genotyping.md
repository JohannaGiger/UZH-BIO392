# Task 1

## GangSTR background reading

### Read the following sections of ‘Profiling the genome-wide landscape of tandem repeat expansions’: Abstract + Introduction, Overview of the GangSTR model

### Afterwards, you should be able to answer the following questions:

## • What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools?

- more accuracy and higher speed, robustly genotyping a range of TR classes
- it is not limited to fragment or read lengths

## • What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping?

- it takes sequence alignments and a reference set of TRs as input and outputs estimated diploid repeat lengths
- as well as other pieces of information such as fragment length, coverage, and existence of partially enclosing reads
