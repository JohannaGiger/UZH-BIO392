Storage Requirements for 1000 Genomes

Different file formats:
  - SAM (Alignments):
    Sequence Alignment Map - human readable text files
    is storing biological sequences aligned to a reference sequence
  
  - BAM:
    Binary Alignment Map - the binary and compressed equivalent to SAM
  
  - VCF (variants):
    Variant Call Format
    for storing genomic variation data
    stores the results of a single or multiple interpretations of genome sequencing datasets, in comparison to a reference genome
    is like a Matrix, where the rows are the variants and the columns are the information of the variants as well as the samples where the variants were found (one row per sample)
    columns are: CHROM (name of the sequence)
                 POS (position of the variation)
                 ID (identifier)
                 REF (referenec base, the base on the reference sequence on this position)
                 ALT (list of alternatibe alleles on this position)
                 QUAL (quality score)
                 FILTER (what filters the variation has passed)
                 INFO (description of the variant, flexible and extensible)
                 FORMAT (description of probes)
                 SAMPLE (can be multiple columns, one for every sample that containss any variant)

- FASTA (Unaligned sequences):
    often used for reference Genomes
    stretches of DNA sequences encoded with A, G, C, T, N (Bases)
    > line contains name and the following lines contain the sequence
    example:
      >NC_009902.1 Babesia bovis T2Bo mitochondrion, complete genome
      TTTAAAAAAGTGTTAAAAACTTTATACATTAAAAAATTTAAACAAGTGATCATGTATAAAGTACACTTGT
      TACTGTGTAAATATCAAAAACAATTTAATTTCAAAATTTTTGAAATATGTTTTTTGTGTTGTGTTATAAA
      ...
      
  - FASTQ :
    is like FASTA but includes quality data as well (the line below the DNA sequence line)
    the quality is represented using Phred score for every single Base - encoded in different single letters and singns 
    these quality scores are logarithmically linked to error probabilities
      - a score of 10 is 1 in 10 - Base call accuracy of 90%
      - a score of 20 is 1 in 100 - Base call accuracy of 99%
      - a score of 50 is 1 in 100'000 - Base call accuracy of 99.999%
    
    example:
      @SRR001666.1 071112_SLXA-EAS1_s_7:5:1:817:345 length=36

  - BED (Genomic ranges):
    Browser Extensible Data
    there are different types of the files for example BED3, BED6, BED12...
    no sequences but only the information about where and how long the sequence is etc.
    
    exapmle:
      BED3: chromosome, start, end
          chr22 1000 5000
          chr22 2000 6000
          ...
      
      BED6: chromosome, start, end and name, score, strand
          chr22 1000 5000 cloneA 960 +
          chr22 2000 6000 cloneB 900 -
          ...

      BED12: chromosome, start, end, name, score, strand and thickStart, thickEnd, itemRgb, blockCount, blockSizes, blockStarts
          chr22 1000 5000 cloneA 960 + 1000 5000 0 2 567,488, 0,3512
          chr22 2000 6000 cloneB 900 - 2000 6000 0 2 433,399, 0,3601


  
Cost factors:
sequencing 1000 Genomes and store them is a big task. the requirements and costs are dependent on multiple factors as for the Coverage, the sequence depth and width as well as what part of the Genome gets stored (whole or just exons? etc.)
and in what format. more information commonly needs more digits and thus more storage capacity, which comes with a higher cost. So choosing the right format to store the Genomes is crucial for the storage requirements and can vary the costs.
