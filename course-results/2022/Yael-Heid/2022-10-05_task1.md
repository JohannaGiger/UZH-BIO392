# what do the bash scripts do?

## 01_unzip_reads.sh
- unzips the compressed wildtype and mutated fasta files

tools and file formats:
- gunzip
- fastq

## 02_bowtie2_index.sh
- builds bowtie indices for the reference sequence

tools and file formats:
- bowtie 2
- fasta

## 03_alignment_bowtie2.sh
-	performs alignment of the wildtype genome against reference genome
-	adds read group information to the generated alignment (needed by GangSTR later on)

tools and file formats:
- bowtie 2
- samtools
- fastq
- SAM

## 04_process_alignment.sh
-	uses samtools view to convert the previous alignments to binary BAM format
-	sort by their starting coordinates 
-	generates index for the alignments

tools and file formats:
- samtools view, sort, index
- SAM, BAM

## 05_run_gangstr.sh
-	runs gangster STR genotyping algorhithm on both mutated and wildtype alignments
-	A reference genome is needed and a tab-seprating file which indicates the STR loci.

- GangSTR
- fasta, BAM, tsv
