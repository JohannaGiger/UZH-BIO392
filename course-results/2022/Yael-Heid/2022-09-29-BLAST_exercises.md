# 1. Use blast in NCBI to search the unknown nucleotide sequence 
• Which organism does this sequence belong to? 
human SARS-CoV-2

• Pick one blast result. What is the accession number, max score, query cover and E value? 
Accession Nr: OP471769.1
max score: 6929
query cover: 100%
E-value: 0.0

• Which region does this sequence cover the subject sequence? (The answer could be different which depends on 
the accession that you choose) 
Range 1: 21579 to 25330?

• Is it DNA or RNA sequence? 
RNA

• Does it encode a (part of) protein? If yes, which protein? (Hint: use different blast type)
Yes, it is part of the surface glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2


# 2. Use blast in Uniprot to search the unknown protein sequence 
• Select the most possible one among manually reviewed entries. What is its Uniprot ID?
P01116 · RASK_HUMAN

• What protein does this sequence come from?
GTPase KRas 

• Which organism does this sequence belong to?
Homo sapiens (Human)

• What is the function of this protein? 
 bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity 
 important role in the regulation of cell proliferation, promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes in colorectal cancer cells

• What is the variant associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in this protein?
Variant-ID: VAR_034601 
Positions: 10
change: G>GG
Description: in AML; expression in 3T3 cell causes cellular transformation; expression in COS cells activates the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway; lower GTPase activity; faster GDP dissociation rate
