Reading up on Genome Technologies

applications in medicine:
Population Genetics - reference assemblies of diverse populations and catalog common structural variants to expand the ethnic diversity of genomic resources
Cancer Research - improve early identification, treatment options, and patient outcomes by better characterizing all the variant types in cancer genomes
Neuroscience Research - identify genetic drivers of neurological, neuromuscular, and neurodegenerative disorders
Immunology Research - complexity of gene-dense immune loci to understand autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, transplantation outcomes, and infectious disease susceptibility
Rare and Mendelian Disease - find causes of unsolved genetic disease to increase solve-rates and disease gene discovery
Microbiology - understanding the genetic makeup of small organisms, address needs for novel therapeutics, environmental remediation, and efficient chemical production
Infectious Disease Research - investigate viruses, bacteria, and protozoa that cause infectious disease
Public Health - protect public health by identifying variant types that drive the spread of antimicrobial resistance and contribute to bacterial virulence


applications in plant and animal sciences:
Insect Biology - disease prevention methods, understand basic biology, and improve pest control using a population or a single individual
Crop Improvements - improve crop health, conduct trait selection, and enhance breeding efficiency
Plant and Animal Microbiology - role of microbial symbionts and pathogens in plant and animal health and disease.
Animal Health and Breeding - animal genetics to study patterns of inheritance, immunology, and domestication in high resolution
Biodiversity and Phylogeny - study evolution, reveal insights into developmental and address challenges of climate change
Conservation - genetic diversity of species-at-risk to support assisted reproduction, wildlife management, and sustainability.



Technologies:

2nd generation:
amplification of seqence
sequencing in cycles, synchronisation required
high number of reads, short sequences, low input

3rd generation:
no amplification
sequencing on single molecules, no synchronisation required
low number of reads, long sequences, high input

exapmles:
Illumina:
2nd generation
1. Library preparation starting from any nucleic acid sample
2. Amplification on a solid surface
3. sequencing using parallel synthesis - sequencing by synthesis
4. alignment and data analysis
have short reads but high throughput (milions in parallel)
optics used for detection


Ion Torrent:
2nd generation
Short reads, low throughput, less time needed
Clonal amplification by PCR - sequencing by synthesis
No optical detection â€“ sequencing is quick
ion current is measured


PacBio:
3rd generation
Single Molecule Real Time Sequencing
watch the DNA Polymerase as it is replicating DNA 
attached Fluorescent dye at the phosphate, the fluophore is clipped off by the polymerase which can be detected
optical detection


Oxford Nanopore:
3rd generation
very long reads, high error rates, expensive, less time needed, can be small machines
DNA strand to be sequenced is transportet through a pore (nanometers in size )
ion current is changed according to the Bases passing through it
this current is measured
