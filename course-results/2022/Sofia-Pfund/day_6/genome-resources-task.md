## Task: Exploring Genome Resources

üëâ Many different places where sequences are stored.

* **UCSC Genome Browser**: 
   * most widely used general genome browser
   * costumization with BED files
   * lots of genome editions available
   * genomes from many species
* **NCBI**:
   * where reference genome data is stored
   * lots of human variants are stored here
* **ENSEMBL**:

### Resources for genome variant data
* NCBI:dbSNP
* NCBI:dbVAR
* NCBI:ClinVar
* EMBL-EBI:EVA

### Resources for cancer genomics
* COSMIC

### Beyond a single resource: federation
* data sharing approaches: combine all the data from different resources
* ‚ÄºÔ∏è federated approach: connecting national genomic initiatives (original data stays on the local resoures): you don't get access to the data itself, but you get back information about the existance of a certain variant in a certain database
* **Progenetix**: focus on data aggregation and curation; most of the data is coming from genomic arrays
* **CURIES**: compact URIs üëâ used to identify resources (prefix + code, e.g. PMID:1234567)
