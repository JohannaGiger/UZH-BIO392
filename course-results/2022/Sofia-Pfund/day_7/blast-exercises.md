## Task 1: use blast in NCBI to search the unknown nucleotide sequence.

* Which organism does this sequence belong to?
A virus: SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/948428/2020, complete genome

* Pick one blast result. What is the accession number, max score, query cover and E value?

First result: 

  - accession number = OP471813.1
  - max score = 6800
  - query cover = 100%
  - E value = 0.0

* Which region does this sequence cover the subject sequence? (The answer could be different which depends on the accession that you choose)
It covers the full sequence.

* Is it DNA or RNA sequence?
It's a DNA sequence.

* Does it encode a (part of) protein? If yes, which protein? (Hint: use different blast type)

## Task 2: Use blast in Uniprot to search the unknown protein sequence

* Select the most possible one among manually reviewed entries. What is its Uniprot ID? 

P01116.

* What protein does this sequence come from?

GTPase KRas.

* Which organism does this sequence belong to?

Homo sapiens (Human).

* What is the function of this protein?

> Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (PubMed:20949621).
Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:23698361, PubMed:22711838).
Plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in a ZNF304-dependent manner (PubMed:24623306).

* What is the variant associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in this protein?

VAR_034601 (check section "Disease and Variants").
