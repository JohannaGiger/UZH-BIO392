## Task 1: use blast in NCBI to search the unknown nucleotide sequence.

Which organism does this sequence belong to?

Pick one blast result. What is the accession number, max score, query cover and E value?

Which region does this sequence cover the subject sequence? (The answer could be different which depends on the accession that you choose)

Is it DNA or RNA sequence?

Does it encode a (part of) protein? If yes, which protein? (Hint: use different blast type)
