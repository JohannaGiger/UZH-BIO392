## Task 1: use blast in NCBI to search the unknown nucleotide sequence.

* Which organism does this sequence belong to?
A virus: SARS-CoV-2/human/USA/948428/2020, complete genome

* Pick one blast result. What is the accession number, max score, query cover and E value?
First result: 

- accession number = OP471813.1
- max score = 6800
- query cover = 100%
- E value = 0.0

* Which region does this sequence cover the subject sequence? (The answer could be different which depends on the accession that you choose)
It covers the full sequence.

* Is it DNA or RNA sequence?
It's a DNA sequence.

* Does it encode a (part of) protein? If yes, which protein? (Hint: use different blast type)
