* oncogenes: usually duplicated in tumor tissues (higher copy number)
* tumor-suppressor genes: usually deleted in tumor tissues (lower copy number)

# Survival Analysis

* Presentation: 10 minutes

* Used dataset: _NCIT:C35813 Hematopoietic and Lymphoid System Neoplasm_

* **Analyse these genes:** (query using Progenetix)
    1) ERBB2+
    2) TP53- (tumor suppressor gene $\Rightarrow$ need to query for deletions on Progenetix)
    3) MYC+
    4) CDKN2A-

* Sequence in the tumor sample is provided as a .csv file

* **Plots**
    * Kaplan-Meier
    * Duplication/deletion of gene per tumor type
    * CNV distribution in different tumor types (violinplot)
    * Your ideas ...

* Exploring the dataset:

* Introduction slides - prognosis, background, genotypes
