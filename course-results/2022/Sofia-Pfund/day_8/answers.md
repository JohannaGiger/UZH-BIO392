## Analysing short tandem repeats in genomic sequences

### Theroy
* short-tandem repeats (STRs): repetitions of 1-6 nt DNA motifs
* STRs are some of the **fastest mutating** loci in the genome
* functional consequences of mutations in STRs: affect gene regualation, induce frameshift mutations, affect alternative splicing
* ‼️ STRs are challenging to genotype: need special tools to genotype them $\Rightarrow$ **GangSTR**
* classic use case: paternity testing

### GangSTR
* input:
  1) reference genome (`.fasta`)
  2) alignment (`.bam`)
  3) locations of STRs in reference genome (*we need to generate this file ourselves*)
* output:
  1) STR genotype (`.vcf`)
