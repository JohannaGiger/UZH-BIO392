## The Kaplan-Meier Method 

most common method of estimating the survival function \
divides time into small intervals where the intervals are defined by the unique times of failure (death) \
we are interested in the probability a subject surviving the next time interval given that they have survived so far


## ICD-O 3

used in cancer registries for coding the site (topography) and the histology (morphology) of neoplasms, usually obtained from a pathology report \
downsides: no ontology, no hierarchical system 


## NCIt

NCIâ€™s core reference terminology and biomedical ontology arencollected in the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) \
individual codes for site-specific occurrences of "biological" diagnoses \
truly hierarchical ontology, empowers "logical OR" queries \


## TNM 
Classification for Clinical Cancer Stage Parameters \
most widely used cancer staging system 

T = size and extent of the main tumor \
N = number/location of nearby lymph nodes that have cancer infiltration \
M = whether the cancer has metastasized 

not used for leukemias or lymphomas \
other disease specific staging systems may (co-) exist

**Example:** \
T1N1M0: small tumor with regional lymph node involvement and no detected distant metastases
