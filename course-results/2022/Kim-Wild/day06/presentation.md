### Presentation

diffrent refrence genomes used in diffrent studies 

samtools \
bcftools \
htslib \
hts-space 

**Liftovers** \
diffrent genome editors shift position of definied elements (genes) \
genome always mapped to the chromosomes \
insertions can lead to a shift \
chain files tell you where shift start and how big it is, display as (+5) insertion of 5 bases 

**Genome resources** \
UCSC genome brower \
human genome resources at NCBI: entry point for genome reference data \
Ensemble: entry point for many genome data services and collections

ClinGen: interpreted genome variants with disease association \
ClinVar basis for curated variant <-> disease associations in ClinGen

data always stays at local database, other people can work with it but results are sent back 

**Progenetix** \
largest open resource for curated cancer genome profiles \
most data from genomic arrays \
SNP + exome sequencing better easier than hole genome sequencing
