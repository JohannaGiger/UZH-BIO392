## Task: Exploring Genome Resources

**UCSC** \
originated from the Human Genome Project \
most widely used general genome browser \
interactive website offering access to genome sequence data from a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species and major model organisms \
allows us to search for specific genes by using for example the name or the position of the gene of interest \
provides a lot of detailed informations about diffrent genes 

**NCBI** \
entry point for genome reference data \
human genome assemblies \
human variant collections (dbVar, ClinVar, dbSNP) for download \
genome browser supporting the exploration and analysis of annotated eukaryotic genome assemblies

**ENSEMBL** \
providing genome data for non-vertebrate species, with tools for the manipulation, analysis and visualisation of that data \
visualize the protein sequence and the sequence variants \
provides a table of transcripts and the according proteins encoded in this regions

**ClinGen** \
interpreted genome variants with disease association \
collects phenotypic and clinical information on variants across the genome 

ClinVar (an NCBI database/resource) is used as basis for curated variant <-> disease associations in ClinGen

**Progenetix** \
largest open resource for curated cancer genome CNV profiles \
majority of data from genomic arrays with ~50% overall from SNP platforms with original data re-processing \
