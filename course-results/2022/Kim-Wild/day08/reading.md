## Task 1

Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? \
-> fastest mutating loci in the genome

What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? \
-> short reads often do not span entire repeats \
-> STR variations present as large insertions or deletions that may be difficult to align to a reference genome


## Task 2

Why should you use multiple tandem repeat detection algorithms to look for repeats in biological sequence? \
-> to find TRs in the refrence genome 

What different functionalities does TRAL provide?
-> for de novo annotations, a scaffold for executing and parsing external TRD software is implemented \
-> a flexible system to establish overlap and clustering of TRs in TRAL \
-> tools to distinguish true from false positve \
-> TRAL can be used to build cpHMMs from each TR for annotation of homologous TRs on other sequences
