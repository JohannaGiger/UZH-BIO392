## Task 1

Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? \
-> fastest mutating loci in the genome

What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? \
-> short reads often do not span entire repeats \
-> STR variations present as large insertions or deletions that may be difficult to align to a reference genome
