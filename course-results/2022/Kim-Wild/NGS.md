# Task: Reading up on Genome Technologies

### General NGS technologies

tecnology for DNA sequencing \
faster and better for bigger genomes than sanger-sequencing \ 

**Principle** 

1. Fragmentation: DNA fragments are generated via zentrifugation 
2. Adaption: adapter oligonucletides bind to the fragments -> library generated 
3. Amplification: fragments get multiplied, many fragments at the same time can be produced \
this makes it so fast 
4. Analyse: data get stored on DNA-chips, sometimes more then 200 GB

**Proceeding** \
diffrent ones are possible, coverage (reads) is diffrent \
reads: DNA-fragment with complement sequence \
human genome has coverage of 30, ilumina or solid sequencing are needed 

*Ilumina* \
nucleotides bound to a terminator and fluroscent pigment \
binding of the bases leed to fluroscence recogniced by a detector \
short reads but very high throughput

*SOLiD* \
16 oligonucleotideprobe with diffrent pigments and 8 bases \
primer binds to probe and signal of pigment is detected 

*semiconductor* \
DNA-clusters surrounded by a semiconductor works as ph-meter \
basepairing leads to release of a protone and ph diffrence get measured 

**Usage** \
espacially in research and clinical genetic, microbiology and onkology 


### (Molecular)-cytogenetic techniques

**Banding analysis** \
used to identify chromosomal abnormalities (translocations) \
unique pattern of light and dark bands are generated for each chromosome
normal and abnormal chromosomes can get identified \
for clinical and research purposes used 

**SNP** \
single nucleotide polymorphisms are single base mutations that are estabilhed in the genepoll of a population \ 
if more than 1% doesn`t carry the same nucleotide at a specific position, dtermined as SNP \
not necessarily seen in a distinct phenotype (disease) 

**M-FISH** \
Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization \ 
24-color karyotyping technique \ 
individual chromosomes are classified based on the fluor composition
