|-------|-------------------|----|--------|
|Hemochromatosis|a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet|HJV|NM_213653.3:c.959G>T|

|Haemophilia|characterized by deficiency in factor VIII clotting activity that results in prolonged oozing after injuries, tooth extractions, or surgery, and delayed or recurrent bleeding prior to complete wound healing.|SERPINC1|NM_000488.4(SERPINC1):c.1246G>T|
|Cystic Fibrosis|multisystem disease affecting epithelia of the respiratory tract, exocrine pancreas, intestine, hepatobiliary system, and exocrine sweat glands.|CFTR|NM_000492.4(CFTR):c.2T>C|
|Tay sachs disease|neurodegenerative disorder in which infants, who are generally normal at birth, have progressive weakness and slowing of developmental progress between ages four and 12 months.|HEXA|NM_000520.6(HEXA):c.1549dup|

|Huntington's disease|condition that stops parts of the brain working properly over time. It's passed on (inherited) from a person's parents. It gets gradually worse over time and is usually fatal after a period of up to 20 years.|PRNP|NM_000311.5(PRNP):c.305C>T |

|Gene|Gene name|Chromosomal location|Gene product|Disease|Disease description|
|----|---------|--------------------|------------|-------|-------------------|
|CFTR|CF transmembrane conductance regulator|7q31.2|epithelial ion channel, transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane|Cystic fibrosis|a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity|		 |
|CYBB|cytochrome b-245 beta chain|Xp21.1-p11.4|Critical component of the membrane-bound oxidase of phagocytes that generates superoxide. It is the terminal component of a respiratory chain that transfers single electrons from cytoplasmic NADPH across the plasma membrane to molecular oxygen on the exterior. Also functions as a voltage-gated proton channel that mediates the H(+) currents of resting phagocytes. It participates in the regulation of cellular pH and is blocked by zinc.|	granulomatous disease|Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a genetic disorder in which white blood cells called phagocytes are unable to kill certain types of bacteria and fungi. People with CGD are highly susceptible to frequent and sometimes life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections.|
|HJV|hemojuvelin BMP co-receptor|1q21.1|Acts as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor (PubMed:18976966). Through enhancement of BMP signaling regulates hepcidin (HAMP) expression and regulates iron homeostasis|Acts as a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) coreceptor (PubMed:18976966). Through enhancement of BMP signaling regulates hepcidin (HAMP) expression and regulates iron homeostasis|ne of the most common genetically-determined metabolic disorders. It leads to the over-absorption of iron, which can result in iron storage in the liver, skin, pancreas, heart, joints, pituitary gland, and testicles.|
|CDKN2A|cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A|9p21.3|Acts as a negative regulator of the proliferation of normal cells by interacting strongly with CDK4 and CDK6. This inhibits their ability to interact with cyclins D and to phosphorylate the retinoblastoma protein|melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome|Melanoma-pancreatic carcinoma syndrome is a rare inherited cancer predisposition syndrome caused by a heterozygous mutation in the CDKN2A gene|
|KRAS|KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase|12p12.1|Ras proteins bind GDP/GTP and possess intrinsic GTPase activity (PubMed:20949621). Plays an important role in the regulation of cell proliferation (PubMed:23698361, PubMed:22711838). Plays a role in promoting oncogenic events by inducing transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in a ZNF304-dependent manner|Noonan syndrome|Noonan syndrome is a genetic disorder that prevents normal development in various parts of the body. A person can be affected by Noonan syndrome in a wide variety of ways. These include unusual facial characteristics, short stature, heart defects, other physical problems and possible developmental delays.|
|TP53|tumor protein p53|17p13.1|cts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type. Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 ex.|Li-Fraumeni syndrome 1|inherited condition that is characterized by an increased risk for certain types of cancer. Affected people often develop cancer at an earlier age than expected and may be diagnosed with more than one cancer during their lifetime.|
|FMR1|fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1|Xq27.3|Multifunctional polyribosome-associated RNA-binding protein that plays a central role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity through the regulation of alternative mRNA splicing, mRNA stability, mRNA dendritic transport and postsynaptic local protein synthesis of a subset of mRNAs |Fragile X syndrome|a genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability|
