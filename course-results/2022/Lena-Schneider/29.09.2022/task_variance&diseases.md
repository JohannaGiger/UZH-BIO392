|Disease|Disease description|Gene|Variants|
|-------|-------------------|----|--------|
|Hemochromatosis|a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet|HJV|NM_213653.3:c.959G>T|
|Thalassemia|An inherited blood disorder characterized by a decreased synthesis of one of the polypeptide chains that form hemoglobin. Anemia results from this abnormal hemoglobin formation.|HJV|NM_213653.4(HJV):c.1006G>T|
|Haemophilia|characterized by deficiency in factor VIII clotting activity that results in prolonged oozing after injuries, tooth extractions, or surgery, and delayed or recurrent bleeding prior to complete wound healing.|SERPINC1|NM_000488.4(SERPINC1):c.1246G>T|
|Cystic Fibrosis|multisystem disease affecting epithelia of the respiratory tract, exocrine pancreas, intestine, hepatobiliary system, and exocrine sweat glands.|CFTR|NM_000492.4(CFTR):c.2T>C|
|Tay sachs disease|neurodegenerative disorder in which infants, who are generally normal at birth, have progressive weakness and slowing of developmental progress between ages four and 12 months.|HEXA|NM_000520.6(HEXA):c.1549dup|
|Fragile X syndrome| genetic disorder characterized by mild-to-moderate intellectual disability.|FMR1|NM_002024.6(FMR1):c.-129CGG[201]|
|Huntington's disease|condition that stops parts of the brain working properly over time. It's passed on (inherited) from a person's parents. It gets gradually worse over time and is usually fatal after a period of up to 20 years.|PRNP|NM_000311.5(PRNP):c.305C>T |
