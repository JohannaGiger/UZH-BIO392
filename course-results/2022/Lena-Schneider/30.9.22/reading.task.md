# Task 1
## STR background reading
- Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease?
  
  > Because it shows that autosomal patterns can have an impact on de novo mutations and in diseases
  
- What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data?

  > That they are hard to detect.

# Task 2
## Introduction to TRAL
- Why should you use multiple tandem repeat detection algorithms to look for repeats in biological sequence?

  > To get all of the benefits of each method and avoid mistakes.

- What different functionalities does TRAL provide?

 > Annotate with sequence profile models <br>
Annotate with *de novo* tandem repeat detectors <br>
Identify and filter overlapping annotations <br>
Test and filter for statistical significance <br>
Retrieve tandem repeat characteristics <br>
Performance evaluation
