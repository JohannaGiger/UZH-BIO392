# GangSTR reading task

### What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools?

GangSTR is a novel algorithm for genome-wide genotyping of short and expanded TRs.
GangSTR is more efficient than alternative methods in both accuracy and speed.
GangSTR will probably enable the discovery of new disease-associated variants not currently accessible from NGS.

### What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping?

It uses linear or logistic regression models at each TR in the genome. It tests for assocciation between TR copy number and phenotype across a cohort of samples.
