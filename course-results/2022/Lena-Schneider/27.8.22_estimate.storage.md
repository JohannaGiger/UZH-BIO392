# Task: Estimate Storage Requirements for 1000 Genomes
## How much computer storage is required for 1000 Genomes?

### WES and WGS
1000 whole genomes are 1/1400 petabyte which is abour 715 Gigabyte

### Different formats:
#### SAM: 
Sequence alignment map. Consists of a header (starts with @) and an alignment section.

#### BAM: 
A single 30x BAM file is 100 GB. Binary version of SAM (so compressed but contain same information). 

#### VCF 
Variant call format: Databank to store information of genomes. It only prints the variations of a base of interest.
This format is only useful if there are not too many samples. Otherwise, too many variations will be detected.

#### FASTA
Starts with a header with information about the sample. Then there is the sequence of nucleotides or amino acids.

#### FASTQ: 
For a whole genome

### Associated costs
To store 1000 genomes in BAM costs about 50000 CHF, but only about half of this is for the raw storage.
Other cost factors are for example duplication and facilities.
