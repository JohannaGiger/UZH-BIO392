# Tasks: Survival analyses | Cancer classifications | Staging

## 1) Familiarize yourself with the different concepts behind different disease clasification systems:
#### - what are there use, advantages, problems? E.g. ICD-10, ICD-O, NCIt. you can use Progenetix to explore e.g. ontology mapping
- ICD-10:
- ICD-0:
- NCIt: NCI’s core reference terminology and biomedical ontology are collected in the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt)
individual codes for site-specific occurrences of "biological" diagnoses. 1 code per cancer.

## 2) Learn to "read" Kaplan-Meier plots (preparation for explorative analyses later this week). 
The most common method of estimating the survival function.
A non-parametric method.
Divides time into small intervals where the intervals are defined by the unique times of failure (death).
Based on conditional probabilities as we are interested in the probability a subject surviving the next time interval given that they have survived so far.

## 3) Achieve a principal understanding of TNM codes & write some "translations"
#### T1N1M0: small tumor with regional lymph node involvement and no detected distant metastases
TNM: A Classification for Clinical Cancer Stage Parameters

T refers to the size and extent of the main tumor

N refers to the the number / location of nearby lymph nodes that have cancer infiltration

M refers to whether the cancer has metastasized

• not used for leukemias / lymphomas
   
    ‣ Binet and Rai in CLL
   
    ‣ proportion of blasts in bone marrow or blood in leukemias 
   
    ‣ Lugano classification in lymphomas

• other disease specific staging systems may (co-) exist
   
    ‣ e.g. a stage II lung cancer is determined by size & nodal involvement
