# Task: Reading up on Genome Technologies
## General NGS technologies
NGS platforms perform sequencing of millions of small fragments of DNA in parallel. Bioinformatics analyses are used to piece together these fragments by mapping the individual reads to the human reference genome. Each of the three billion bases in the human genome is sequenced multiple times, providing high depth to deliver accurate data and an insight into unexpected DNA variation.

1. Library Preparation
     - The sequencing library is prepared by random fragmentation of the DNA sample, followed
by 5′and 3′adapter ligation. 

2. Amplification
     -  Each fragment is amplified into distinct, clusters throug hbridge amplification.

3. Sequencing
     -  Single bases are detected as they are incorporated into DNA template strands

4. Data Analysis
     -  During data analysis and alignment, the newly identified sequence reads are aligned to a reference genome.


## Molecular-cytogenetic techniques:
### banding analysis
Chromosome banding refers to alternating light and dark regions along the length of a chromosome, produced after staining with a dye. A band is defined as the part of a chromosome that is clearly distinguishable from its adjacent segments by appearing darker or lighter with the use of one or more banding techniques. The banding pattern can distinguish chromosomal abnormalities or structural rearrangements, such as translocations, deletions, insertions, and inversions.

|Banding type|Staining|
|-----|-----|
|C-banding|Constitutive heterochromatin|
|G-banding|Giemsa satin (Dark bands: Heterochromatin, Light bands: Euchromation)|
|Q-banding|Quinacrine (bands that fluoresce on exposure to UV ligh; patterns can be correlated with G-bands|
|R-banding|Reverse Giemsa staining (Dark bands: Euchromation, Light bands: Heterochromatin)|
|T-banding|Telomeres|
