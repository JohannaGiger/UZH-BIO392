Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? \
STR expansions have been implicated in dozens of dis-orders The majority of repeat disorders identified so far follow
autosomal dominant inheritance patterns that were readily identified using linkage analysis in pedigrees

What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? \
a) PCR amplification introduces “stutter” errors in the number of repeats. \
(b) Local sequence alignment is challengiang at complex repeats. \
(c) Long repeats cannot be spanned by short reads. \

What different functionalities does TRAL provide? \

- Annotate with sequence profile models 
- Annotate with de novo tandem repeat detectors
- Identify and filter overlapping annotations
- Test and filter for statistical significance
- Retrieve tandem repeat characteristics



What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools? \
genome-wide genotyping of STRs and expanded TRs, enables discovery of novel disease-associated variants, angSTR relies on a general statistical model incorporating multiple prop- erties of paired-end reads into a single maximum like- lihood framework capable of genotyping both normal length and expanded repeats. 
GangSTR is faster and more accurate than existing solutions at the time of paper written.
What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping? \
GangSTR incorporates reads on repeat-enclosing reads, fragment length, coverage and targeted genotyping of expanded STRs into a single joint likelihood framework.
GangSTR has many features for genotyping such as enclosing, FRR, Spanning, Off-target FRR, estimates, genome-wide and is not limited by fragment or read-length!
