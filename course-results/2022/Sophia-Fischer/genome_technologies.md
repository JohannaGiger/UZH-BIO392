# Genome technologies

## Overview NGS technologies
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a massively parallel sequencing technology that offers ultra-high throughput, scalability, and speed. The technology is used to determine the order of nucleotides in entire genomes or targeted regions of DNA or RNA.

## long-read sequencing (LRS)
LRS has the capacity to sequence on average over 10 kb in one single read, thereby requiring less reads to cover the same gene. LRS technologies may offer improvements in the characterization of genetic variation and regions that are difficult to assess with the prevailing NGS approaches. \

Principle for all NGS technologies: Generating DNA fragments, adding specific adapters to fragments, creating a library, amplification and clustering of fragmented DNA, parallel sequencing of clusters and lastly analysing the genomic data.

## short-read sequencing (SRS)
To sequence a large genome like human DNA using NGS, the DNA has to be fragmented and amplified in clones of between 75 base pairs and 400 base pairs.

## Count based vs. intensity based technologies

### Intensity based 
  - Intensity based technologies measure fluorescence intensities from dye-labeled molecules to determine the sequence of DNA fragments.

## Molecular-cytogenetic techniques
### Banding analysis
Chromosome banding techniques produce a series of consistent landmarks along the length of metaphase chromosomes that allow for both recognition of individual chromosomes within a genome and identification of specific segments of individual chromosomes.

### SNP, aCGH arrays
A SNP array is used to detect polymorphisms (SNPs). SNP arrays can detect long contiguous stretches of heterozygosity  \
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method for analysing copy number variations (CNVs). This allows for comparison between two sources.

### SKY, M-FISH
Multicolor FISH (mFISH), also known as spectral karyotyping (SKY), and multiplex-FISH (M-FISH) permit the simultaneous visualization of each chromosome pair in a different color.

### cCGH
  Chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization is useful to analyse CNVs relative to ploidy level in the DNA, always compared to a reference gene. Widely used to compare genomes of healthy tissue to the ones of tumour tissue. 

When the techniques are compared to each other, cCGH has an improved resolution over traditional G-banding and FISH. \
Of particular interest to the application of SKY and M-FISH is its usefulness in cross-species banding.
