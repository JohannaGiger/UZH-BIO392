## Raw data:
INSDC (spectrum of raw data reads, including DDBJ, EMBL-EBI and NCBI data)
GSA (first repository of the genome sequence data with international journal recognition in China)



## Genetic variation data:

### dbSNP 
- human variations less than 50bp
- SNPs
-includes insertions and deletions, microsatellites, non-polymorphic variants
### bVar 
-human variations greater than 50bp 
-genomic structural variation
- insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, multinucleotide substitutions, mobile element insertions,
translocations, complex chromosomal rearrangements

### ClinVar
- human genotype & phenotype
-realationship between genomic variation and human health

### European Variation Archive (EVA)
- all species
- open access
###Â Genome Sequence Archive for Human
- GSA human

### Ensembl
- vertebrate genomes
- datatypes BLAST, BLAT, BioMart and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP)


## VICC paper notes
### goal
harmonize variant interpreation for six cancer variant knowledgebases \

precision oncology- treatment is informed by the genetic profiling of a cancer (mutations) \
The Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium (VICC) is a Driver Project of GA4GH, established to co-develop standards for genomic data sharing. \
