Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease? \
STR expansions have been implicated in dozens of dis-orders The majority of repeat disorders identified so far follow
autosomal dominant inheritance patterns that were readily identified using linkage analysis in pedigrees

What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? \
a) PCR amplification introduces “stutter” errors in the number of repeats. \
(b) Local sequence alignment is challengiang at complex repeats. \
(c) Long repeats cannot be spanned by short reads. \

What different functionalities does TRAL provide? \

- Annotate with sequence profile models 
- Annotate with de novo tandem repeat detectors
- Identify and filter overlapping annotations
- Test and filter for statistical significance
- Retrieve tandem repeat characteristics
