# survival analysis
## Kaplan-Meier method
for estimating survival funciton \ 

two types of events (death/ censored) \
censored= last date of observation \

single-tails \


try to associate genomic events to different clinical parameters (survival, behaviour, treatment...) \
is deletion x related to y problem? \
