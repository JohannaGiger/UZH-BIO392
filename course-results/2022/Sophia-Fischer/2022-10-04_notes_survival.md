# survival analysis
## Kaplan-Meier method
for estimating survival funciton \ 

two types of events (death/ censored) \
censored= last date of observation \

single-tails \


try to associate genomic events to different clinical parameters (survival, behaviour, treatment...) \
is deletion x related to y problem? \
Familiarize yourself with the different concepts behind different disease clasification systems - what are there use, advantages, problems? E.g. ICD-10, ICD-O, NCIt
you can use Progenetix to explore e.g. ontology mapping
Learn to "read" Kaplan-Meier plots (preparation for explorative analyses later this week). 

The Kaplan-Meier curve is used to estimate the survival function from data that are censored, truncated, or have missing values. It shows the probability that a subject will survive up to time t. The curve is constructed by plotting the survival function against time. \
