# Task 1

## GangSTR background reading

### Read the following sections of ‘Profiling the genome-wide landscape of tandem repeat expansions’: Abstract + Introduction, Overview of the GangSTR model

### Afterwards, you should be able to answer the following questions:

## • What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools?

- more accuracy and faster speed as well as robustness in genotyping
- not limited by fragment or read  length 

## • What types of information does GangSTR use for STR genotyping?
  
- takes sequence alignments and a reference set of TRs as input and outputs estimated diploid repeat lengths
- other pieces of information like fragment length, coverage, and existence of partially enclosing reads
