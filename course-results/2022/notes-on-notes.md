* use logical nesting - there should only be one `<h1>` (_i.e._ `# Title`) element
* use newlines between headers and text, and around lists etc.
* you can force line separation by adding 4xspace at the line's end - no `<br/>` necessary...
* use lists - also nested ones
    - 4 spaces per level ...
* code blocks are nice & easy, with a triple backtick <code>```</code> before and after

## Cytogenetics, FISH, CGH ...

* while M-FISH & SKY offer visualization of many & complex changes they still
require living cells for metaphase preparations

## Sequencing  & Array Technologies

* SNP arrays provide additional allele specific information => LOH ...
* SNP arrays are frequently not "pure" SNP arrays but may contain additional
probes to improve e.g. CNV detection or that of recurring somatic SNVs etc.
