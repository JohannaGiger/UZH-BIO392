# TASK 1
## Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease?
- Deletions and insertions occur often
- Can cause diseases
## What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? 
- Used sequences are too short
- Sequence must be longer than repeat itself
## Why should you use multiple tandem repeat detection algorithms to look for repeats in biological sequence?
- To find TRs in the refrence genome
- The different algorightms create redundant or overlapping annotations, several statistical frameworks for filtering false positive annotations
## What different functionalities does TRAL provide?
- System to establish overlap and clustering of TRs in TRAL
- Distinguish true from false positve
