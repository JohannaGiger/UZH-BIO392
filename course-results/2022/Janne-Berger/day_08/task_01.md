## TASK 1
# Why is STR variation relevant to health and disease?
- Deletions and insertions occur often
- Can cause diseases
# What are some of the challenges in analysing STRs from NGS data? 
- Used sequences are too short
- Sequence must be longer than repeat itself
# Why should you use multiple tandem repeat detection algorithms to look for repeats in biological sequence?
# What different functionalities does TRAL provide?
