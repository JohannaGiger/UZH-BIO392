# General NGS technologies
## Ilumnia (Sequencing by synthesis)
- Short reads but very high throughput
- Clonal amplification on a glass slide by bridge amplification
- State-of-the-art optics used for detection
## Ion Torrent
- Method for DNA sequencing in which protons released during replication are detected with a semiconductor
- Short reads, low/medium throughput
- Clonal amplification on beads by emulsion PCR
- No optical detection: sequencing is quick
- No modified nucleotides
- Well suited for targeted approaches
## PacBio
- Single Molecule Real Time Sequencing
  - Fluorescent dye attached to the terminal phosphate. Leaves natural DNA strand upon incorporation
  - Fluorophore clipped off by polymerase
  - DNA synthesized is natural
  - No steric hindrance or accumulation of background signal
- Applications: 
  - de novo genome sequencing
  - structural variations
  - high fidelity sequencing
  - full length transcript analysis
  - epigenetics
## Oxford nanopore
- The nanopore can processes the full length of the DNA or RNA
- An motor enzyme controls the translocation of DNA or RNA strand through the nanopore. Once it has passed through, the motor protein detaches and the nanopore is ready to accept the next fragment 
- The nanopore signal, captured by the ASIC in the device, is characteristic of the sequence of the DNA fragment. Algorithms are used to convert the signal into basecalled data
- An electrically resistant membrane means all current must pass through the nanopore, ensuring a clean signal 
# Banding analysis
- Banding can be used to identify chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations, because there is a unique pattern of light and dark bands for each chromosome
- Used in chromosome karyotyping to identify normal and abnormal chromosomes for clinical and research purposes
# SNP
- Single nucleotide polymorphisms are variations in base at certain positions in the genome
- If more than 1% of a population does not carry the same nucleotide at a specific position in the DNA sequence, then this variation can be classified as a SNP
- not essentially causing a disease but can be brought along with other SNP (Haplotypes)
# M-FISH
- Multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization is a color karyotyping technique 
- good technique for complex chromosome rearrangements <br>
