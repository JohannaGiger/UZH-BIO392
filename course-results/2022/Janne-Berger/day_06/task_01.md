# Primary deposition databases 
- Primary databases are populated with experimentally derived data such as nucleotide sequence, protein sequence or macromolecular structure
- Experimental results are submitted directly into the database by researchers, and the data are essentially archival in nature
- Examples
  -ENA, GenBank and DDBJ (nucleotide sequence)
  -Array Express Archive and GEO (functional genomics data)
  -Protein Data Bank (PDB; coordinates of three-dimensional macromolecular structures)


# Genome resources
## UCSC genome browser
- originated from the Human Genome Project and the most widely used general genome browser
- allows us to search for specific genes by using for example the name or the position of the gene of interest
- provides a lot of detailed informations as the position of the gene of interest in the chromosome or the legth of it, to list only a few
- can download an annotated data and sequence of our gene of interest


# Humane genome resources at NCBI
- an entry point for genome reference data and allows to look and visualize for different reference genomes
- also connected to other NCBI resources 

# Ensembl
- genome browser for vertebrate genomes 
- able to annotate genes, compute multiple alignments and collect disease data
- provides a table of transcripts and the according proteins encoded in this regions
- visualize the protein sequence and the sequence variants

# Cosmic
- resource for exploring the impact of somatic mutations in human cancer
- provides nicely informations to the gene, the drug resistance associated with mutations on the gene and the distribution of mutations in the gene accross tissue types
