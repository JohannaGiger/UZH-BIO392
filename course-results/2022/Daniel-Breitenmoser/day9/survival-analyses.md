## Disease classification systems

- ICD-10: _International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems_ (10th revision) by the WHO.
  - no hierarchical ontology
  - not always possible to find appropriate code for every disease
  - widely accepted
- ICD-O: The Edition that contains Oncology diseases.
- NCIt : National Cancer Institute Thesaurus
  - individual codes for site-specific occurences of diagnoses
  - truly hierarchical ontology
  - empowers logical queries

## Kaplan-Meier plots

The Kaplan-Meier plots are self-explanatory in my opinion

## TNM codes

- T refers to the size and extent of the main tumor
  - T1: < 3cm
  - T2: < 3cm
  - T3: any size but near airway or has spread to local areas
  - T4: any size but is in the airway, or has invaded local structures
- N refers to the number/location of nearby lymph nodes that have cancer infiltration
  - N0: No lymph nodes affected
  - N1: spread to nearby nodes on the same side of the body
  - N2: spread to nodes further away on the same side of the body
  - N3: present in lymph nodes on the other side of the chest, or in nodes near the collarbone or neck muscles
- M refers to whether the cancer has metastasized
  - M0: no metastases are present
  - M1: tumour has spread to other regions of the body
   

- T1N1M0: small tumor with regional lymph node involvement and no detected distant metastases.
- T3N2M0: tumor near airway which has spread to nodes further away on the same body side and no metastases.
- T1N3M1: small tumor with lymph node involvement on the other body side and distant metastases.
