|Thalassemia|	a gen defect where hemoglobin is not generated enough and red blood cells get sick	|	HJV	|	NM_213653.4(HJV):c.1006G>T|
|Haemophilia|	s a mostly inherited genetic disorder that impairs the body's ability to make blood clots, a process needed to stop bleeding	|	SERPINC1	|	NM_000488.4(SERPINC1):c.1246G>T 	|
|Cystic Fibrosis|	Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition. It's caused by a faulty gene that affects the movement of salt and water in and out of cells	|	NPHP4	|	NM_015102.5(NPHP4):c.3930_3939del	|
