### Primary deposition databases 
Primary databases are highly organised, user-friendly gateways to
the huge amount of biological data produced by researchers around the world

There are three nucleotide repositories or primary databases for the submission of nucleotide and genome sequences:

  1. GenBank hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 
  2. The European Nucleotide archive or ENA hosted by the European Molecular Biology Laboratories (EMBL). 
  3. The DNA Data Bank of Japan or DDBJ hosted by the National Centre for Genetics. 
  
Together they form the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration. [^1]

### interpreted databases
By contrast, secondary databases comprise data derived from the results of 
analysing primary data.

### VICC paper (wagner et al (2020))

They aggregated cancer variant interpretations from six distinguished constituent knowledgebases: the Cancer Genome Interpreter Cancer Biomarkers Database (CGI), Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC), Jackson Laboratory Clinical Knowledgebase (JAX-CKB), MolecularMatch (MMatch), OncoKB and the Precision Medicine
Knowledgebase (PMKB)

Their analysis uncovered highly disparate content in curated knowledge, structure and primary literature across these knowledgebases. \
The findings uncovered the need for a cooperative, global effort to curate comprehensive and thorough clinical interpretations \
of somatic variants for robust practice of precision medicine. \
They harmonized these interpretations of the 6 databases and made them freely available at search.cancervariants.org

### Different genome resources and their primary use [^3]

- **Assembly**: A database providing information on the structure of assembled genomes, assembly names and other meta-data, statistical reports, and links to genomic sequence data.
- **ClinVar**: A resource to provide a public, tracked record of reported relationships between human variation and observed health status with supporting evidence.
- **Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)**: A database of  human genes and genetic disorders.
- **MedGen**: A portal to information about medical genetics. MedGen includes term lists from multiple sources and organizes them into concept groupings and hierarchies.
- **Database of Short Genetic Variations (dbSNP)**: Includes single nucleotide variations, microsatellites, and small-scale insertions and deletions. dbSNP contains population-specific frequency and genotype data, experimental conditions, molecular context, and mapping information for both neutral variations and clinical mutations.
