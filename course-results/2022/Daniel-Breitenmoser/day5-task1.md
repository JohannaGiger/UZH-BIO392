### WES and WGS

Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), 1-2% of genome \
Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) \ 

### Different file formats

Different file formats require different amounts of data to be stored.

### Cost of sequencing 

When the Human Genome Project was finished, the costs summed up to about 3 billion USD   \
Today we are in the "1000$ genome" era. [^1] \
The costs range from 300$ to 1000$ depending on where it is sequenced and on the quality of sequencing.\

###  Storage cost
The storage costs differ much from each other  \
Storing 1000 Exomes per year (6TB generated per year), stored for 10 years costs between 0.5$ and 12$ depending mostly on retrieval time.[^2] \
It is estimated that the cost to store a single genome is approximately 14$ to 300$ over ten years depending on how and where it is stored \

### The vcf format

example:

vcf = variant call format \
It contains meta-information lines, a header
line, and then data lines each containing information about a position in the genome.
