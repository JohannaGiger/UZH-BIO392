### Task 1:

#### - What sets GangSTR apart from other STR genotyping tools?

GangSTR outperforms alternative methods in both accuracy and speed.
Our analysis reveals that healthy individuals harbor dozens of long TR alleles not captured by current genome-wide methods. 
GangSTR will likely enable discovery of novel disease-associated variants not currently accessible from NGS.





#### - What types of information does GangSTR use for Str genotyping?

GangSTR relies on a general statistical model incorporating multiple properties of paired-end reads into a 
single maximum likelihood framework capable of genotyping both normal length and expanded repeats.

Takes sequence alignments and a reference set of TRs as input and outputs estimated diploid repeat lengths.
