|CFTR|CF transmembrane conductance regulator|7q31.2|epithelial ion channel, transport of chloride ions across the cell membrane|Cystic fibrosis|a genetic disorder characterized by the production of sweat with a high salt content and mucus secretions with an abnormal viscosity|
|CYBB|cytochrome b-245 beta chain|Xp21.1-p11.4|cytochrome b, which is an important component of the microbicidal oxidase system of phagocytes|granulomatous disease, chronic, X-linked|a disorder of phagocyites where we have impaired killing of bacteria and fungi, which leads to immunodeficiency|
