| number | SNP (rsID) | Gene / Region | Notable Trait / Use |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| 1      | rs7903146  | _TCF7L2_      | Type 2 Diabetes     |
| 2      | rs1426654  | _SLC24A5_     | Skin Pigmentation   |
| 3      | rs429358   | _APOE_        | Alzheimer's Disease |
| 4      | rs334      | _HBB_         | Sickle Cell Anemia  |
| 5      | rs12913832 | _HERC2_       | Eye Color           |

For each SNP, answer the following:

  
| SNP (rsID)   | Chromosome and position | Variant Type | Reference/ alternate allels| MAF |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | -------------| -------------------------- | --- | 
| rs7903146    |  10q25.2                |  intronic    | ||

* What is the allele frequency of this SNP in different populations (e.g., AFR, EUR, EAS)?
* What differences do you observe? You may include figures (e.g., allele frequency charts from Ensembl) to illustrate your observations.
* Choose one GWAS study involving the SNP and describe the associated trait or disease, including the reported p-value,
  effect size (OR or beta), publication details, predicted functional consequences, and include a link to the study from the GWAS Catalog.
