Ramos-Lopez O. Genotype-based precision nutrition strategies for the prediction and clinical management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. World Journal of Diabetes. 2024 Feb;15(2):142-153. DOI: 10.4239/wjd.v15.i2.142. PMID: 38464367; PMCID: PMC10921165. 

### Background
Globally, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common metabolic disorders. T2DM physiopathology is influenced by complex interrelationships between genetic, metabolic and lifestyle factors (including diet), which differ between populations and geographic regions. In fact, excessive consumptions of high fat/high sugar foods generally increase the risk of developing T2DM, whereas habitual intakes of plant-based healthy diets usually exert a protective effect. Moreover, genomic studies have allowed the characterization of sequence DNA variants across the human genome, some of which may affect gene expression and protein functions relevant for glucose homeostasis. This comprehensive literature review covers the impact of gene-diet interactions on T2DM susceptibility and disease progression, some of which have demonstrated a value as biomarkers of personal responses to certain nutritional interventions.

### From: GENETIC POLYMORPHISMS AS BIOMARKERS OF GLYCEMIC RESPONSES TO DIETARY ADVICE

Also, obese individuals who were homozygous for the T-risk allele of the transcription factor 7 like 2 (TCF7L2) rs7903146 polymorphism and consumed a high-fat (40%-45% E) diet, underwent smaller reductions in HOMA-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)[44].
