## Unknown Protein Seq

**Uniprot ID:** P01116.1</br>

**Which Protein does it come from?** GTPase KRas isoform a </br>
**Source organism:** *Homo sapiens*</br>
**Protein Function:**</br>
This gene, a Kirsten ras oncogene homolog from the
mammalian ras gene family, encodes a protein that is a member of
the small GTPase superfamily. A single amino acid substitution is
responsible for an activating mutation. The transforming protein
that results is implicated in various malignancies, including lung
adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenoma, ductal carcinoma of the pancreas
and colorectal carcinoma. Alternative splicing leads to variants
encoding two isoforms that differ in the </br>
C-terminal region. [Ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/NP_203524.1?report=genbank&log$=protalign&blast_rank=1&RID=ZJ4T7GR3013)
