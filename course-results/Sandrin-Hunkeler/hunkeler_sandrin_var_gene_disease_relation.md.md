## Variants and diseases

### Search Strategy

For ClinVar I filtered for Germline, Pathogenic and Multiple Submitters. Then I selected one of the top most promising variations.
For ClinGen I switched between searching for the gene and the disease. The search results for all elements were unambiguous.
For the Gene Product and the Disease I searched online using [Medi+](https://medlineplus.gov/).
