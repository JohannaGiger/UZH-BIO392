## üß¨ SNP Exploration 
Below is a list of curated SNPs for exploration: 

---

| number | SNP (rsID)  | Gene / Region | Notable Trait / Use |
|---------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 1       | rs7903146   | *TCF7L2*       | Type 2 Diabetes      |
| 2       | rs1426654   | *SLC24A5*      | Skin Pigmentation    |
| 3       | rs429358    | *APOE*         | Alzheimer's Disease  |
| 4       | rs334       | *HBB*          | Sickle Cell Anemia   |
| 5       | rs12913832  | *HERC2*        | Eye Color            |

Please investigate each of SNP using the following databases:

- **GWAS Catalog**: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas  
- **Ensembl Variant Browser**: https://www.ensembl.org
  
## üìå **Tip**
- Use the LocusZoom in GWAS Catalog and population frequency features in Ensembl to explore regulatory impact and population distribution!
- Refer to this link for guidance on the GWAS Catalog, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/gwas-catalogue-exploring-snp-trait-associations/

## üîç Tasks
For each SNP, answer the following:

1. What chromosome and position is the SNP on?
2. What is the variant type? (e.g., intronic, missense)
3. What are the reference and alternate alleles?
4. What is the minor allele frequency (MAF)?
5. What is the allele frequency of this SNP in different populations (e.g., AFR, EUR, EAS)? What differences do you observe? You may include figures (e.g., allele frequency charts from Ensembl) to illustrate your observations.
6. Choose one GWAS study involving the SNP and describe the associated trait or disease, including the reported p-value, effect size (OR or beta), publication details, predicted functional consequences, and include a link to the study from the GWAS Catalog.
